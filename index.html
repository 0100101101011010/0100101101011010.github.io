<p><i>
  I have a longing for life, and I go on living in spite of logic. Though I
  may not believe in the order of the universe, yet I love the sticky little
  leaves as they open in spring. I love the blue sky, I love some people,
  whom one loves you know sometimes without knowing why. I love some great
  deeds done by men, though I've long ceased perhaps to have faith in them,
  yet from old habit one's heart prizes them.

<p>&mdash; Fyodor Dostoevsky, "The Brothers Karamazov"</p>
