    <h2>Welcome to my site</h2>
    <p>I'm a first-year student at the University of Waterloo. This website is

      life! I don't really have coding experience and I'm kind of doing this site
      by the seat of my pants so
      please let me know about any mistakes or glitches you experience.

  I have a longing for life, and I go on living in spite of logic. Though I
  may not believe in the order of the universe, yet I love the sticky little
  leaves as they open in spring. I love the blue sky, I love some people,
  whom one loves you know sometimes without knowing why. I love some great
  deeds done by men, though I've long ceased perhaps to have faith in them,
  yet from old habit one's heart prizes them.
