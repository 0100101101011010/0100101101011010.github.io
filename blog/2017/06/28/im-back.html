            Hey all, I'm back!! I've found, over the years, that whenever I try
            keeping a journal or blog I jump too enthusiastically into it for a
            number of days or weeks, and soon I get exhausted and abandon it.
            Usually I delete my old entries, but for this one I didn't, which
            must be a sign, right? Maybe this attempt is the one that sticks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every time I resurrect a project I try to do something differently,
            something that I hope will strike a balance between simple and
            beautiful so it's easy enough to keep updating yet aesthetic enough
            that I won't be ashamed of what I wrote ten years on. So these are
            the things I'm doing differently this time:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I'm cutting out the "aesthetic" part. The "beautiful" part. Part
              of the reason I get burnout so quickly writing these posts is
              because I'm always striving for perfection. I'm done with that
              shit. It's totally against what I'm trying to do here, which is
              expressing my thoughts and reliving my memories in as genuine a
              manner as possible. From this post onward I'm no longer going to
              be meticulously editing each post, chasing after the perfect word
              to describe every feeling, smoothing my work to create a uniform
              writing style and cutting out all my idiosyncrasies&mdash;it takes
              too much effort.
            </li>
            <li>
              Not all my posts will be essay-length anymore. If I only feel
              like writing a paragraph on a subject, that's how much I'll write.
              I won't force myself to dissect and over-analyze every event that
              happens; just recording it is enough.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            That's it for now. A lot has happened in the past months, and I'm
            not sure how much of it I can get down, or how long my new spurt of
            inspiration will last, but this time I'll try focusing more on my
            own beliefs and getting my thoughts down, even if they're unpolished.
          </p>
