            Clytemnestra was a queen of Greek legend who was most infamous for
            murdering her husband Agamemnon, together with her lover Aegisthus,
            upon his arrival home from the Trojan War. Following on the heels
            of similar reinterpretations of ancient Greek heroines such as
            Alcestis (Katharine Beutner, <em>Alcestis: a novel</em>) or
            Penelope (Margaret Atwood, <em>The Penelopiad</em>),
            <em>Clytemnestra's Last Day</em> seeks to continue the trend of
            reimagining Greek myths in modern feminist contexts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clytemnestra makes for an interesting character: despite a terrible
            reputation, she is one of only a few women in Greek mythology who
            exhibit power and initiative&mdash;traditionally male qualities.
            Despite the compelling premise, author S. Montana Katz's
            <em>Clytemnestra</em> falls short of eliciting any meaningful kind
            of empathy for its protagonist. The doomed queen gives the
            impression of a woman confused and deranged, unable to stop
            repeating her version of events and returning, incessantly, to
            memories of all who wronged her. Filled with regret, self-hatred,
            and bitterness, she spends the story seeking someone else to blame
            for her life's troubles.
          </p>
          <p>
            In <em>Clytemnestra's Last Day</em>, Katz has taken a controversial
            figure and, rather than helping the audience to better understand
            her actions, turns this complex woman with agency into nothing more
            than a victim.</p></section>
