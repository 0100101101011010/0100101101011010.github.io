It meant that you were spiritually inclined. And if you were spiritually inclined around here, it probably wasn't Sunday school that got you that way. Rather, it was a combination of hard drugs and deep injustice to yourself. It was the last resort.</p>

          <p>This was a pretty good book. I liked this book. It centered around two young Francophones, Nicolas and Nouschka, living out their lives as disgraced (well, not so much disgraced as somewhat forgotten) former child stars in 90's Montreal. Our most notorious province of Quebec, in the Western Canadian imagination, was a place full of snooty and filthy semi-depressed alcoholics who insisted on acting as if they inhabited a different country and drained the entire nation's finances to boot.</p>
          <p>(In fact, just today on the news there was a piece about a mobster who was shot dead inside his car in Montreal. What the hell! It was bizarre enough that Canada had a mafia problem in the first place, but leave it to the East Coast to find a way to fuck around with organized crime.)</p>
          <p>
            Despite its backdrop and its Quebec-born author,
            <em>The Girl Who Was Saturday Night</em> does not try to challenge any
            stereotypes about Quebec and, in fact, seems to validate some of them. Then
            again, O'Neill has depicted here isn't your typical tourist brochure Montreal;
            this is the Montreal of a particular sect, the proud and the lost and the
            disillusioned, people like Nicolas and Nouschka Tremblay.
          </p>
          <p>Nicolas and Nouschka shared everything. Being twins, they made frequent reference to the fact that from their very first moments they had been together, and presumably never saw a reason to change this. It was practically incestuous, the things they would do with each other.</p>
          <p>With all the things they had in common, perhaps the most striking difference was that Nouschka had dreams of doing something, oh, <em>different</em> with her life, and Nicolas, on the other hand, in his fatalistic, Quebecois way, "knew that nothing was ever going to change."</p>
          <p>The Tremblay twins also lacked a mother (a sore point for both of them), and, while they knew their father, a once-legendary, still fairly famous singer, they didn't hold him in very high regard. The siblings' parental problems did not feel like central plot points so much as convenient excuses for all their eccentricities. Whenever Nicolas did something outrageous/illegal or Nouschka acted on her impulses, it could be traced back to a scarcity of parental love and guidance.</p>
          <p>There was a lot of repetitiveness in the book, and I believed that was intentional, because it helped to emphasize one of Nouschka's greatest challenges: the struggle to break away from her old life (in particular, her and Nicolas' interdependence) and become a mature, successful adult. She attempted this through several methods: signing up for night school, landing a better job, marrying a half-mad boyfriend, moving out of the family home, getting pregnant. But she always ended up in the same place she had tried to leave, ie. wherever Nicolas happened to be.</p>
          <p>(I got the feeling that just about everybody in <em>The Girl</em>was stuck in a situation they didn't want to be in, and yet at the same time couldn't imagine leaving.)</p>
          <p>Unfortunate end result: stagnation, which led eventually to boredom on the part of the reader. It wasn't that O'Neill stopped coming up with novel ideas or ran out of fresh shit to get her characters into, but simply that the Tremblays' endless attempts to grow up, followed by their failure, got old after 300 pages. Like the story of any child star past his/her prime, there came a point when Nicolas and Nouschka's antics failed to arouse my interest anymore. If the book had been pared down to maybe a hundred pages less, I would've left with a much better impression.</p>
          <p>Still, in the end, I was happy for Nouschka. She seemed to be moving on, albeit slowly, getting somewhere, ready to contribute to the world&mdash;unlike her brother, who ended up in the same jail their father had been locked up in years ago after robbing a bank. Nobody likes a static character. That was what Nicolas was, truthfully. He not only didn't change, he adamantly refused to.</p>
          <p>I was proud of Nouschka for having the guts to begin to form her own identity, distinct from her brother's. We left her contemplating her own struggle to stay or to go, mirrored by the 1995 Quebec independence referendum happening at the same time. If she had given me a say, I would have voted <em>Oui</em>.</p>
