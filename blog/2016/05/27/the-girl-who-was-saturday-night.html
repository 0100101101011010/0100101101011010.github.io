            There wasn't much scarier than a tattoo of Jesus.
            It meant that you were spiritually inclined.
            And if you were spiritually inclined around here,
            it probably wasn't Sunday school that got you that way.
            Rather, it was a combination of hard drugs and deep injustice

          <p>
            <i>The Girl Who Was Saturday Night</i> centers around two young
            French Canadians, Nicolas and Nouschka Tremblay, eking out their
            lives as disgraced (perhaps not so much disgraced as forgotten)
            former child stars in 90's Montreal. The province of Quebec, in
            the imagination of many Canadians further west than them, is up to
            its nose in snooty, semi-depressed alcoholics who
            insist on acting as if they inhabit a different country and
            drain the entire nation's finances to boot.</p>
          <p>
            Despite its backdrop and its Quebec-born author, <em>The Girl Who
            Was Saturday Night</em> does not try to challenge any stereotypes
            about Quebec and, in fact, seems to validate some of them. Then
            again, what O'Neill has depicted here isn't your typical tourist
            brochure Montreal; this is the Montreal of a particular sect,
            the proud and the lost and the disillusioned, people like Nicolas
            and Nouschka Tremblay.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nicolas and Nouschka are twins who share everything. They make
            frequent reference to the fact that they've been together from
            their very first moments alive, and have never seen a reason to
            change this.
            With everything they have in common, perhaps the most striking
            difference is that Nouschka has dreams of doing something, oh,
            <em>different</em> with her life, and Nicolas, on the other hand,
            in his fatalistic, Quebecois way, "knew that nothing was ever
            going to change."
          </p>
          <p>Eventually, the book becomes highly repetitive, which
            helps to emphasize one of Nouschka's
            greatest challenges: the struggle to break away from her old life
            (in particular, her codependency on Nicolas) and become an adult
            instead of the child star she has always known.
            She attempts this through several methods: signing up for
            night school, landing a better job, marrying her very unstable
            boyfriend, moving out of the family home, getting pregnant. But she
            always ends up in the same place she tries so hard to leave,
            that is, wherever Nicolas happens to be. (You get the feeling pretty
            quick that just about everybody in
            <em>The Girl Who Was Saturday Night</em>
            is stuck in a situation they don't want to be in, and yet at the
            same time can't imagine leaving.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, at a certain point the repetition becomes less poetic
            and more resemblant of O'Neill attempting to hammer the themes of
            the story into one's skull. The Tremblays' endless attempts to grow up,
            followed by their failures, are charming and at times shocking, but
            after 300 pages the routine gets old. Like the fate of any child star past
            his/her prime, there comes a point when Nicolas and Nouschka's
            antics no longer arouse any interest.
          </p>
          <p>
            Still, in the end, it's bittersweet to see the book, and with it
            Nouschka's story, come to a close. By the end of the book, she is
            moving on, albeit slowly, getting
            somewhere, ready to contribute to the world&mdash;unlike her
            brother, who winds up in the same jail their father was imprisoned
            in years ago after robbing a bank. Nobody likes a static
            character. That's what Nicolas is, truthfully. He not only doesn't
            change, he adamantly refuses to.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>The Girl Who Was Saturday Night</i> offers a touching look into
            a girl's journey to leave her childhood behind and form
            her own identity, distinct from her brother's. We leave her
            contemplating her own decision to stay or to go, mirrored by the
            1995 Quebec independence referendum happening at the same time.
            If she could give me a say, I would vote <em>Oui</em>.
