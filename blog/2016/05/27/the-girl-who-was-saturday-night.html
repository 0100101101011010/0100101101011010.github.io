            There wasn't much scarier than a tattoo of Jesus.

            This is a pretty good book. I like this book. It centers around
            two young French Canadians, Nicolas and Nouschka, living out their lives
            as disgraced (well, not so much disgraced as somewhat forgotten)
            former child stars in 90's Montreal. The province of Quebec, in
            the imagination of many Canadians further west than them, is a
            place full of snooty and filthy semi-depressed alcoholics who
            insist on acting as if they inhabit a different country and
            drain the entire nation's finances to boot.</p>
          <p>
            (In fact, just today on the news there was a piece about a
            mobster who was shot dead inside his car in Montreal. It was
            bizarre enough that Canada had a mafia problem in the first
            place, but leave it to the East Coast to find a way to fuck around
            with organized crime.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite its backdrop and its Quebec-born author,
            <em>The Girl Who Was Saturday Night</em> does not try to challenge any
            stereotypes about Quebec and, in fact, seems to validate some of them. Then
            again, what O'Neill has depicted here isn't your typical tourist brochure Montreal;
            this is the Montreal of a particular sect, the proud and the lost and the
            disillusioned, people like Nicolas and Nouschka Tremblay.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nicolas and Nouschka are twins who share everything. They make
            frequent reference to the fact that they've been together from
            their very first moments alive, and have never seen a reason to
            change this.
          </p>
          <p>
            With everything they have in common, perhaps the most striking
            difference is that Nouschka has dreams of doing something, oh,
            <em>different</em> with her life, and Nicolas, on the other hand,
            in his fatalistic, Quebecois way, "knew that nothing was ever
            going to change."
          </p>
          <p>There's a lot of repetitiveness in the book, and I believe that's
            intentional, because it helps to emphasize one of Nouschka's
            greatest challenges: the struggle to break away from her old life
            (in particular, her codependency on Nicolas) and become a real
            adult. She attempts this through several methods: signing up for
            night school, landing a better job, marrying her very unstable
            boyfriend, moving out of the family home, getting pregnant. But she
            always ends up in the same place she tries so hard to leave,
            that is, wherever Nicolas happens to be.
          </p>
          <p>
            You get the feeling pretty quick that just about everybody in
            <em>The Girl Who Was Saturday Night</em>
            is stuck in a situation they don't want to be in, and yet at the
            same time can't imagine leaving.
          </p>
          <p>The unfortunate result of this is stagnation, which led
            eventually to boredom on my part. It's not that O'Neill stops
            coming up with fresh ideas for subplots, but simply that the
            Tremblays' endless attempts to grow up, followed by their failure,
            gets old after 300 pages. Like the fate of any child star past
            his/her prime, there comes a point when Nicolas and Nouschka's
            antics no longer arouse my interest. If the book had been
            pared down to maybe a hundred pages less, I would have left with
            a much better impression.
          </p>
          <p>
            Still, in the end, I was sad to see the book, and with it Nouschka's
            story, come to a close. She is moving on, albeit slowly, getting
            somewhere, ready to contribute to the world&mdash;unlike her
            brother, who ends up in the same jail their father had been locked
            up in years ago after robbing a bank. Nobody likes a static
            character. That's what Nicolas is, truthfully. He not only doesn't
            change, he adamantly refuses to.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's inspiring to see Nouschka grow the guts to begin to form
            her own identity, distinct from her brother's. We leave her
            contemplating her own decision to stay or to go, mirrored by the
            1995 Quebec independence referendum happening at the same time.
            If she could give me a say, I would vote <em>Oui</em>.</p>
