            I'm reading a few books this month: <i>An Englishman in Madrid</i>,
            <i>The Girl Who Was Saturday Night</i>, and <i>Night Work</i>, which
            is part of a <i>Michael Cassidy</i> series that I've never
            heard of. Every book in the mystery genre I pick up these days seems
            to be part of this or that series. I'm really not a fan of this
            model: in general, when it comes to crime fiction, I choose novels
            based on locale, maybe gruesomeness, but never based on characters.
            Except, you know, Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot. But I only
            like Poirot because he's short and Belgian.
          </p>

          <p>
            <i><b>An Englishman in Madrid</b></i> reminds me of Sting's song
            about Englishmen in New York, which can be credited as one of the
            reasons I wanted to read it, but the real hook is the setting.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <i>They attack us because they're afraid of us. And they're afraid
            of us because reason and history are on our side. We are the
            future, and the weapons of the past are useless against the future.</i>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            At the time of writing, I'm a little over halfway through the novel.
            It's set in the years of unrest before the Spanish Civil War, with
            the protagonist as a man named Anthony Whitelands, a British art expert
            who specializes in 17th-century Spanish art. Velazquez and the shit.
            He falls in love with an aristocratic girl named
            Paquita-I-don't-remember-her-real-name and also with a very valuable
            Velazquez painting that her family is hiding.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have mixed feelings about Anthony. As a rule of thumb I have
            little patience for British people. Anthony Whitelands possesses some of
            the characteristics of what to my mind is the stereotypical Englishman:
            he's sarcastic, likes to believe he's analytical, hesitant, and
            foolish around people of other nationalities. The Spaniards call
            him Tony, or Anto√±ito, which I think is much cuter than old Anthony.
            His naivete when it comes to Spain is somewhat endearing, as is
            his equally naive love for Paquita. I guess that's why I like him.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <i>"But I'm not Catalan," Anthony explained. "I'm English."<br />
            "Heavens! I'm so sorry. What with your strange accent and fact that
            you didn't leave a tip..."</i>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            <i><b>The Girl Who Was Saturday Night</b></i> might turn out to be my favourite
            read of 2016. (Yes it's only May.) It's written by a Canadian, and a
            beautiful one at that, which makes me feel I should love it even
            more. The book is about two cynical, selfish Quebecers. You might think
            that would make them very unsympathetic (especially the Quebecer part),
            but the opposite turns out to be true.
          </p>

          <p>
            Their names are Nouschka and Nicolas Tremblay and they are twins of
            a famous father who's always in jail and a mother who'd abandoned
            them as babies. They're nineteen years old. Now, this weirds me out
            more than anything else in the book because I've always considered
            anybody above the age of majority to be a full-fledged adult, but as
            I read about Nouschka and Nicolas, I realized that being nineteen years
            old meant they were only two years older than I was. I mean,
            they were out smoking and drinking and sleeping around with middle-aged
            people, definitely adult things, while here I was worrying about
            getting good grades, whether the guy I liked liked me back, and which
            universities were going to accept me.
          </p>

          <p>
            Was there the remotest possibility that in two years I'd end up like
            them? I found it hard to even imagine. Maybe the differences are
            owed to the fact that I have parents who actually care about me.
          </p>


          <p>
            Nouschka and Nicolas are together so often that there's an almost
            incestual tinge to their relationship. They use all sorts of
            couple-terms to describe each other (two halves of a whole, that
            kind of thing), and might as well be conjoined. But Nouschka, the
            narrator, is the more mature one out of the two. Nicolas gives me the
            impression of a man who tries too hard at coming off as not having
            tried at all: he thinks he's better than everyone but at the same
            time wants nothing more than their attention. He needs to be different
            from the norm, to be doing things nobody else is doing.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <i>He loved risky behaviour more than anything else. Ah, the
              things that Nicolas had to do to feel alive. It was beautiful.</i>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            Nouschka is more sincere, although her confessions are mostly confined
            to within her mind. On the outside, I think she's as bad as Nicolas.
            She wants to improve herself, although she's not certain of the steps
            involved. Furthermore, she's capable, to some extent, of real optimism.
          </p>
          <p>I like her.</p>

          <p>
            There are so many cats in the book. Nouschka always uses a metaphor
            to describe them. Like a skinny boy in a jumper. Or a regretful girl
            the morning after a one-night stand. I wonder why in books boys are
            never the ones to regret one-night stands?
          </p>

          <p>
            <i><b>Night Work</b></i>'s main character is Michael Cassidy, a
            policeman. I didn't care about Michael Cassidy originally, but he
            grew on me more than most crime fiction protagonists as the book went
            on. The book jacket promised that at least part of the story
            takes place in Cuba during the Cuban Revolution. As mentioned,
            setting is important to me, and that played a big role in my reading it!
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm not very far into it: thirty whole pages. I don't have anything
            deep to say about it either. It's just a regular crime novel with a
            lot of guns in it, and some politics. I do wish that the author
            didn't have to give Cassidy a relationship, because there's no point
            dedicating a subplot to a love story which has nothing to do with
            the rest of the situation. Then again, I'm' only thirty pages in.
            Judgements will be reserved for later!
