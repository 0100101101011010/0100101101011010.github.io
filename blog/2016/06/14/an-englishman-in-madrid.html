            Don't say a word. You Protestants always think you have to say

            or brutal must be the truth. But things are not like that. Miracles
            and fairy tales are not illusions. They express a hope. Perhaps
            heaven is only a hope too. Even so, it helps us live. Truth cannot
            be an illusory hope. I'm not asking you for an explanation, I don't
            reproach you for anything, I'm not demanding anything of you. But
            you can't rob me of hope, Tony. Not today or tomorrow, but perhaps
            someday, things will be different.

            Eduardo Mendoza's Planeta Prize-winning novel, <em>An Englishman
            in Madrid</em>, set in the 1930's, explores the tense and
            dangerous atmosphere of a Spain on the brink of civil war
            from the perspective of a foreigner.
          </p>
          <p>
            The titular character of the novel is a slow-on-the-uptake Londoner
            named Anthony Whitelands. A professor and specialist of Spanish art,
            Anthony travels to Madrid to evaluate a collection of paintings,
            only to find himself caught in the crossfire between the increasingly
            violent fascist and communist factions that are overrunning the
            capital. Through a series of unlucky coincidences and drunken
            decisions, Anthony winds up a helpless pawn in a political struggle
            he barely understands. During his stay in Spain, he encounters such
            figures as the founder of the Spanish Falange, Jos&eacute; Antonio
            Primo de Rivera, and future dictator Francisco Franco. As one
            exasperated Spanish policeman puts it, "nothing can happen in this
            country without that devil of an Englishman being mixed up in it!"
          </p>
          <p>
            The humour in this book is subtle, but could be described as
            typically English. One can't help but grin at Anthony's fumbling
            and bumbling (will readers ever get tired of the
            clueless-Briton-abroad trope? I know I won't), or his grasping
            attempts to draw himself out of the predicaments he finds himself
            in. I also had a good laugh at the character of Edwin Garrigaw
            (an unpleasant old man who is Whitelands' professional rival),
            whose name is surely not a coincidence.
          </p>
          <p>
            One aspect that could use more editing is the novel's use of tense.
            A complete disregard for past/present-tense may throw readers off,
            and in one instance, I noticed the tense change no less than three
            times in a single chapter.
          </p>

            How Mendoza manages to convey an atmosphere that is sometimes
            farcical and, at other times, startlingly serious, is beyond me.
            His novel is a rich, satirical glimpse into the chaotic political
            climate of Spain at this time. For readers who aren't interested
            in the politics of the Spanish Civil War, however, certain chapters
            will be dull.
