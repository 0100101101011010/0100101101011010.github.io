            All you need to know is two words for my Spanish/Italian yogurt
            experience: <em>HOooOoLY SHITTT</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            You know what, Southern Europeans have NO IDEA how good they have
            it because trying to compare the yogurt in North America to what's
            available over there is like... well, there's no real way to
            compare them since they're not even remotely similar, but even so,
            it's common sense to say the latter is far superior.

          <h3>De Nuestra Tierra (10/10)</h3>
          <p>Madrid. Reviewed on 01/21.</p>
          <img src="/blog/thumbs/denuestratierra.png" class="pull-left" style="margin: 1px;">
          <p>
            I had to google what "oveja" means, and apparently it's Spanish for
            "sheep." When was the last time you had <em>sheep milk yogurt</em>?
            It tasted great. I can't describe <em>how</em> it's different from
            normal yogurt, exactly, but that you can definitely tell it's
            something else. Perfect amount of sugar added. Creamy beyond belief.
          </p>
          <p>
            To top it off, the ceramic yogurt cup is adorable, and after a rinse
            it's now performing wonderfully as my toothbrush holder.
          </p>
          <h3>Danone (2/10)</h3>
          <p>Madrid. Reviewed on 01/22.</p>
          <img src="/blog/thumbs/danone.png" class="pull-left" style="margin: 1px;">
          <p>
            The facts that, 1) I've had bad experiences with Danone and 2) there
            were <em>minions</em> decorating the label of this cup, should've
            sent me screaming down the aisle in the opposite direction as fast
            as my legs could take me, but unfortunately I was tricked by the
            labelling which claimed it was "Macedonia" flavour. My curiosity was
            piqued instantly. What did "Macedonia" flavour even mean? How could
            yogurt taste like an entire region in Southeastern Europe? Certainly
            we did not have this flavour back home, so I bought it and gave it
            a try.
          </p>
          <p>
            I regretted my decision as soon as the first spoonful hit my tongue.
            It tasted exactly like the artificial, pudding-like,
            vaguely-fruity-but-ultimately-ambiguous sugary stuff that
            proliferates on American store shelves. Turns out that
            <em>macedonia</em> in Spanish is short for <em>macedonia de frutas</em>,
            aka fruit salad. Aka huge disappointment. As a non-Macedonian,
            I find this offensive.

          <h3>Yosoi (7/10)</h3>
          <p>Rome. Reviewed on 01/25.</p>
          <img src="/blog/thumbs/yosoi.png" class="pull-left" style="margin: 1px;">
          <p>
            Soygurt with real blackberries! How much better can you get? It was
            on the sweet side, and there were lots of blackberry
            seeds&mdash;gave my tongue quite the massage. Pretty runny compared
            to the North American varieties of soygurt I've encountered, but
            that's a characteristic I've noticed in most of the yogurt here,
            soy or not.
          </p>
          <h3>Giglio (6/10)</h3>
          <p>Rome. Reviewed on 01/27.</p>
          <p>Giglio didn't make much of an impression on me. It tasted fine, yeah, but nothing stood out. I'd still pick it over most brands available at my local grocery any time of day.</p>
          <p>[gallery ids="1080,1081" type="rectangular"]</p>
          <h3>Soia (8/10)</h3>
          <p>Rome. Reviewed on 01/27.</p>
          <p>I prefer this soygurt over the Yosoi. The taste is similar, but it's a bit smoother and thicker.</p>
          <p>[gallery ids="1053,1054,1055" type="rectangular"]</p>
          <h3>AgriLanga (9/10)</h3>
          <p>Rome. Reviewed on 01/28.</p>
          <p>One of those fruit-at-the-bottom varieties... although in Italy, the fruit/jam is usually found at the top of the cup lol. This particular brand had a perfect ratio of jam to yogurt; it's not as sweet as most of the other yogurts I had on this trip, but makes up for it in creaminess factor. It's thick and sticky and you can absolutely taste the shit-ton of milk that doubtless went into making this. Comes in a cute little glass container, reminiscent of the De Nuestra Tierra cup.</p>

          <h3>Caseificio Val d'Aveto (8/10)</h3>
          <p>Rome. Reviewed on 01/29.</p>
          <p>I know, I know... it looks disgusting... but <em>SO GOOD</em>...</p>
          <p>I bought these for the novel flavours (kiwi and pomegranate). They didn't look very appealing what with the watery juice and neon green fruit bits swilling around at the top, but the taste is great. I can't say it's a natural flavour, but it's delicious all the same. The only reason I wouldn't buy again is for fear of whatever neon green chemicals I'm putting into my body.</p>

          <h3>Azienda Agricola San Maurizio (5/10)</h3>
          <p>Rome. Reviewed on 01/29.</p>
          <p>This brand was the closest I got to "North American-style" yogurt. Sweeter than the other varieties I tried, with less of the creamy taste.</p>
          <p>[gallery ids="1138,1139" type="rectangular" link="file"]</p>
          <h3>Yomo &amp; Melinda (7/10)</h3>
          <p>Pisa. Reviewed on 01/30.</p>
          <p>I bought this for the cheap price (most yogurts in Italy are around &euro;1&ndash;&euro;2 for two cups, and this one was &euro;0.69) and the nostalgia. Do you remember when Activia carried the "apples &amp; dates" flavour that mysteriously disappeared a few years ago? It was always my favourite... fuck you, Activia... Anyways, this Yomo thing had apples on it so I decided to try it out. It's not bad, especially at 35&cent; a cup. And it did taste like the "apple &amp; dates" Activia yogurt despite having no dates.</p>

          <h3>Mukki (5/10)</h3>
          <p>Pisa. Reviewed on 01/30.</p>
          <p>This was the last yogurt I bought on the trip, and the only drinkable one. I was not a fan; I thought it tasted weird and not really like blueberries as advertised, but my parents loved it. That's quite odd because neither of them are huge on yogurt. You do you Mom and Dad.</p>
          <p><img class=" size-medium wp-image-1161 aligncenter" src="https://seenontheshelves.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/img_20160129_113043-21.jpg?w=300" alt="IMG_20160129_113043-2" width="300" height="300" /></p>
          <p>
            This is just a suspicion, but I think the EU has stricter food laws
            than Canada and America do. Or Europeans and North Americans have
            very different tastes when it comes to yogurt. Here at home, most
            grocery store yogurts don't taste creamy in the slightest and feel
            sort of gelatinized, probably because so many are low-fat. By
            contrast, I could <em>very</em> clearly taste the dairy in all the
            yogurt I tried in Spain and Italy (except the discouraging Danone).
            The yogurt there was also a lot thinner and runnier than most
            in America.
          </p>
          <p>I guess that concludes this special edition of
            <em>Yogurt in Review.</em> Thank you, thank you!
