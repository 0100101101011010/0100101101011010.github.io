            <em>Barbara the Slut</em> is an honest, modern&mdash;albeit
            sometimes generic&mdash;collection of stories about youthful love,
            sex, and identity. Holmes' style is deceptively simple, using
            sparse language and leaving much to the reader's interpretation. I would hope,
            however, that Holmes' lovers represent only a fraction of the young adult
            population, given so many of the stories feature characters who are at best
            mistrustful, at worst apathetic, about
            their partners in love.
          </p>
          <p><em>How Am I Supposed to Talk to You?</em> is the first story of
            the collection, and my favourite (for very superficial reasons,
            I won't lie: my love for it hinges on the beachside setting and
            the propensity of the characters for wearing underwear, bikinis,
            and other scanty clothing).
          </p>
          <p>
            Our narrator, Lala, and her mother have been estranged since
            middle school, but one summer she flies down to mom's beach-side
            hotel with the aim of "generally [making] up for the ten years I
            was in California, in middle school, and high school, and
            college&mdash;and she was in Mexico, in the city, and then at the
            beach." From this line alone, Lala's feelings are made clear: she
            sees her visit to her mother as a duty, as something she feels
            obliged to undertake out of guilt rather than affection.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite the expressions of love that mother and daughter exchange,
            their long period of separation colours their interactions with an
            awkwardness expected of two people who hover on the border between
            familiarity and formality. Holmes deftly portrays this complicated
            relationship, with Lala and her mother treating each other sometimes
            with familial intimacy and other times, or even simultaneously,
            with cautious and strangerly politeness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both have secrets they've kept from the other: Mom has a boyfriend,
            Martin; Lala a girlfriend, Dana. The confessions themselves are not
            the focus of the story; rather, their purpose is to serve as
            examples that highlight the increasing disconnect between mother
            and daughter. "How am I supposed to talk to you?" Lala demands
            to know before their meeting with Martin, when mom tells her she
            only speaks Spanish around her boyfriend. While the language
            barrier is a literal problem ("I haven't spoken Spanish since I
            was five," says Lala), the question on a metaphoric level sums up
            the overarching theme of the story. It is not a language barrier
            they face, it is an emotional one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lala is hurt by her mother's preoccupation with other errands,
            when what really matters is the time they spend as a family. Every
            one of the excursions they embark on happens to serve a second
            purpose. They go to the beach, ostensibly to relax in each other's
            company&mdash;but also to sell underwear at marked-up prices.</p>
          <p>
            Lashing out at (or perhaps just wanting to escape) the sense
            that her affection is not at the top of her mother's priority list,
            Lala packs up and goes to her grandfather's house in Mexico City.
            Relations between her grandfather and her mother are even frostier.
            Together, the mother's three failed
            relationships&mdash;the grandfather, Lala, and Lala's
            father&mdash;hints at some character flaw, perhaps, that causes people
            who should be closest to her to fall away. Perhaps it is her inability
            to understand, or put thought into, the feelings of people who love
            her. Her world is heavily centered around herself: she is almost
            more concerned with selling Victoria's Secret than for her own
            daughter; she accuses Lala of "breaking my heart" for showing
            apparent favouritism towards her father; she is initially reluctant
            to tell Martin that she has a daughter at all, fearing it will
            ruin his "simple" image of her.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, in Lala, Holmes illustrates the difficulty in overcoming
            the feelings of detachment that a long period of separation may
            cause. While she treasures the fond childhood memories of her
            mother, in the present reality she is no longer a child and does
            not know how to act or feel around the other.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              At first, I had been worried for them [the cliff divers], but now
              it seemed less real, like they were on automatic or something, or
              like I was watching them from very far away.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>While the leaping of the divers off the cliff at Acapulco can
            ostensibly be interpreted as Lala 'taking the plunge' in coming
            out to her mother, it has another meaning as well. What lies
            below the cliffs is unknown, mysterious. When Lala chooses to ride
            off to Mexico City away from her mother, and for them to go their
            separate ways once more, she has no idea what the future holds for
            their relationship. And yet, despite that, leaving is strangely easy.
