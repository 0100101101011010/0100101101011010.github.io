          <p>Easily digested and fun to read, <em>The Lumber Room</em>, a tale
            of  one boy's struggle against the foolishness of adults, makes
            for an excellent introduction to the short story form.</p>
          <p>
            From the first paragraph, our hero Nicholas is presented as a
            troublemaker and a rebel against the established order. An
            incident involving a frog in the breakfast bowl makes clear his goal:
            to prove that "older, wiser, and better people" can in fact be
            "profoundly in error in matters about which they had expressed the
            utmost assurance."
          </p>
          <p>
            The aunt, principal antagonist of the <em>The Lumber Room</em>,
            is described as "one of those people who think that things spoil
            by use and consign them to dust and damp by way of preserving them,"
            establishing in few words her position as an oppressive force.
            The other children in the story are mentioned offhandedly as
            Nicholas' "boy-cousin and girl-cousin and his quite uninteresting
            younger brother," suggesting that our protagonist considers them
            below him and unworthy of further description. His opinion of them
            may be due in part to their deference towards their aunt&mdash;an
            attitude which he, significantly, does not share.
          </p>
          <p>
            The namesake of the story, the lumber room, is an storage nook of
            old tapestries, animal-shaped teapots and books with beautiful
            pictures. It represents an escape from the stifling rules and
            punishments imposed on Nicholas by the aunt. A book he picks up
            contains images of fantastical birds, a symbol of freedom. The
            tapestry, however, is the most important object in the room,
            transfixing Nicholas from the moment he lays eyes upon it. The
            scene it depicts mirrors his own situation: the hunter in the
            tapestry, momentarily basking in his triumph, will soon have to
            face the advancing wolves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Later in the story, a rain-water tank catches and imprisons the
            aunt when she falls down, placing her at the mercy of Nicholas.
            This mishap of the aunt's is deliberately structured: not only
            does it show a subversion of her power over Nicholas and the other
            children's lives, it also happens to occur within her garden, on
            her <em>home turf</em>, heightening the effect of irony and
            highlighting the fragility of her apparent power. The aunt's
            authority suffers another blow when her "punitive expedition" to
            Jagborough Cove turns out to be a failure.
          </p>
          <p>
            The effortlessness and effectiveness of undermining the aunt
            encourages Nicholas, causing him to think back to the hunter in
            the tapestry scene and consider the man's predicament in a more
            optimistic light. Although the hunter only has two arrows left in
            his quiver to repel four preying wolves, he may yet find a way to
            preserve himself, if he has the sense to run and leave the fallen
            stag to sate the wolves. Similarly, Nicholas, despite his seemingly
            powerless position with regards to his aunt, can hope to rely on
            both wits and coincidence to challenge her despotic control over
            the "bare and cheerless" household and, more importantly, over
            himself.
