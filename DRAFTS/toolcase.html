<p>
  Every few years or so, one of my New Year's Resolutions will be to learn a
  new language. And every few years, the same thing inevitably happens: I open
  up my old Duolingo account, check out some grammar books from the library,
  and invest the next few days in energetically trying to cram as many foreign
  words into my brain as possible. Soon enough, my task turns from fun to
  arduous and I put it off for a day, days becoming weeks, months, years.
</p>

<p>
  Nagi An knows these struggles well—after all, she has herself studied German,
  Spanish, English, and Japanese—and <i>Tool Case</i> is a culmination of her
  experience, endeavouring to help us to study smarter, not harder.
</p>

<p>
  The book is split into five chapters, each focusing on a different aspect of
  mastering a language and arranged in order of advancing complexity: simple
  memorization, making connections, practicing, reading and listening, and
  speaking and writing.
</p>

<p>
  Having studied Spanish in high school in addition to my independent forays
  into language-learning, I was no stranger to several concepts outlined in
  this work, such as chunking new words and creating diagrams. Others, however,
  were foreign to me. Collocations? Timeboxing?
</p>

<p>
  But An does her best to keep this short, densely-packed manual from becoming
  overwhelming. The format isn't pretty, but it gets the job done. As she makes
  clear, it is no way her intention that all 40 tools in this book be used by
  every learner. Instead, readers can choose from the array of strategies to
  devise a learning plan that works well for them.
</p>

<p>
  Information is grouped in short, manageable segments that can be quickly
  consumed in between classes, waiting for a bus, or any time when one can spare
  five minutes. The author knows her audience well: the self-help industry is
  these days full of books, apps and games marketed to audiences who want to
  master something in a short period of time, while putting in minimal effort.
  However, An still emphasizes the need for regular practice and a sustained
  effort in order to properly learn a language.
</p>

<p>Readers may also find that certain tools go far beyond their original
  purpose. Strategies like the Pomodoro Technique and using existing habits as
  a "trigger" (such as reviewing five vocabulary words while getting into bed,
  or repeating a newly learned phrase a few times before eating each meal)
  work with learning just about anything, not only languages. As such,
  although information on the techniques explored in An's book could be
  found on the web through a lot of digging and searching, <i>Tool Case</i>
  presents them in a clear and succinct summary—with the science to back it
  up—that's worth the read for every budding language learner.
