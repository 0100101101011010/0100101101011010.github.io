  <title>Kelly's Flashcards and Notes</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Comprehensive flashcards for the UW courses I've taken. Some high school stuff here too. Flashcards are the easiest way for me to retain information. At this point, I don't take notes for my classes anymore. It's all flashcards all the way, baby. I use the Anki software to create and host them. Anki also allows sharing decks publicly, which is what I've done with some of the courses I've completed, as below." />

    <p>I used to use Anki religiously for all my courses since high school. I didn't rely on any other form of note-taking. This worked well up until about 2A at which point I felt like the fairly inflexible structure of flashcards made them a less-than-optimal optimal tool for courses that test more than rote memorization. I'm now a fully indoctrinated <a href="https://www.remnote.io/">RemNote</a> shill so all 200-level courses and above (except BIOL 240) are provided in RemNote, while all 100-level courses remain in the Anki format.</p>
    <p>For all Anki files (.apkg extension): You can download <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki for free here</a>. (You must use the desktop version to import these flashcards; there is no option through the web browser version of Anki afaik.) Once you have Anki installed on your computer, download the flashcard decks you want from the list below. Double-clicking the downloaded .apkg file should open up the flashcard deck in Anki automatically; if not, right-click and select "open with".</p>
     <p>(I know a lot of people prefer using Quizlet, and yeah there's a way to import these decks into Quizlet, although idk about what that'll do to the cards with images or cloze deletions. But if you really want them in Quizlet format anyway, <a href="/contact">message me</a> and I'll show you how to convert them!)</p>
    <p>For all RemNote links: These can be viewed on any modern web browser. No login required, however, if you want to take advantage of the flaschard/SR functions then you do need to sign up for a free account.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yoUDyfQvCI4lK82GM6xFOljAP2ZGMywx">AFM 101</a></h2>
        <p>See my review for the course <a href="/blog/thoughts-on-my-1a-courses/">here</a>.</p>


        <h2><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EoEBuXVRHyZbW17zC4Y-4-c6PyWVTm-8">AFM 102</a></h2>
        <p>WAAAAAY easier than AFM 101. And actually interesting. One of my favourite first year courses.</p>
    
        <h2><a href="https://www.remnote.io/a/afm-274/6140efdc1e3e3700344cfa0b">AFM 274</a></h2>
        <p>Better than AFM 273!</p>
    
        <h2><a href="https://www.remnote.io/a/afm-311/6140ee26e6644800346e63d5">AFM 311</a></h2>
        <p>Not as boring as it sounds, and not hard to do well.</p>
    
        <h2><a href="https://www.remnote.io/a/afm-391/6140f4624ba00c003419672c">AFM 391</a></h2>
        <p>These notes are about 90% complete. There are maybe 5 or 6 lines of notes that I didn't finish (marked by ??).</p>

            <h2><a href="https://www.remnote.io/a/afm-481/6140fc8cb46c07003413f53c">AFM 481</a></h2>
        <p>For this course especially, doing practice problems is more useful than going over notes imo.</p>
    
        <h2><a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/707193547">AP BIOLOGY (Advanced Placement)</a></h2>
        <p>Actually, this is a combined deck for both AP Bio and the Alberta Bio 20/30 curriculum. There's a lot of overlap between these two courses and I was taking them simultaneously, so I didn't bother separating the two at the time.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JLKtXmk0ZhysoIb_byN2JuM81-YsNFMd/view?usp=sharing">BIOL 240</a></h2>
        <p>Assumes you have a basic knowlege of bio (BIOL 130 or high school level), but still covers some review of introductory cellular biology.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yCA0ZcqaLL2erxBnNXiGx0CLMgl2a9qP">CHEM 120</a></h2>
        <p><i>For CHEM 120 only, not CHEM 120L!!</i> (Although there is overlap between the finals, this deck does not provide comprehensive coverage of exam content for CHEM 120L.) See my review for the course <a href="/blog/thoughts-on-my-1a-courses/">here</a>.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1evDCfbDvi34REdi00WOl9VU4btTUyKMo">CHEM 123</a></h2>
        <p><i>For CHEM 123 only. Does not include content for CHEM 123L!!</i></p>

        <h2><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Z1P3LAbKP7wGJxkSXdrs5A_2Q_DxkjM7">ECON 101 and 102</a></h2>
        <p>Including this deck is kind of questionable because... uh... it's pretty messy. It's a combined deck for Micro and Macro. ECON 101 is covered in full, but the ECON 102 cards don't include content from the last several chapters (aka the point at which I gave up on the course). I didn't use tags to separate 101 and 102, which also makes it kind of a pain sorry :-(</p>
