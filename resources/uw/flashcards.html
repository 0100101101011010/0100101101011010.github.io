  <title>flashcards | Hi I'm Kelly and I Love My Life</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Comprehensive flashcards for the UW courses I've taken. Some high school stuff here too. Flashcards are the easiest way for me to retain information. At this point, I don't take notes for my classes anymore. It's all flashcards all the way, baby. I use the Anki software to create and host them. Anki also allows sharing decks publicly, which is what I've done with some of the courses I've completed, as below." />

    <p>Flashcards are the easiest way for me to retain information. At
      this point, I don't take notes for my classes anymore. It's
      all flashcards all the way, baby. I use Anki, so the links below are
      to .apkg files. If you have Anki on your computer, double-clicking the
      downloaded file should open them up automatically; if not, right-click
      and select "open with".
    </p>
    <p>I know a lot of people prefer using Quizlet, and yeah there's a way to
      import these decks into Quizlet, although idk about what that'll do to
      the cards with images or cloze deletions. But if you want them in Quizlet
      format anyway, <a href="/contact">message</a>
      me and I'll show you how to convert them!

        <h2><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yoUDyfQvCI4lK82GM6xFOljAP2ZGMywx">AFM 101</a></h2>
        <p>See my review for the course <a href="/blog/2018/05/31/thoughts-on-my-1a-courses/">here</a>.</p>


        <h2><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EoEBuXVRHyZbW17zC4Y-4-c6PyWVTm-8">AFM 102</a></h2>
        <p>See my review for the course <a href="#">here</a>.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/707193547">AP BIOLOGY (Advanced Placement)</a></h2>
        <p>Actually, this is a combined deck for both AP Bio and the Alberta Bio 20/30 curriculum. There's a lot of overlap between these two courses and I was taking them simultaneously, so I didn't bother separating the two at the time.</p>

        <h2>BIOL 240</h2>
        <p>Assumes you have a basic knowlege of bio (BIOL 130 or high school level), but still covers some review of introductory cellular biology.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yCA0ZcqaLL2erxBnNXiGx0CLMgl2a9qP">CHEM 120</a></h2>
        <p><i>For CHEM 120 only, not CHEM 120L!!</i> (Although there is overlap between the finals, this deck does not provide comprehensive coverage of exam content for CHEM 123L.) See my review for the course <a href="/blog/2018/05/31/thoughts-on-my-1a-courses/">here</a>.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1evDCfbDvi34REdi00WOl9VU4btTUyKMo">CHEM 123</a></h2>
        <p><i>Does not include content for CHEM 123L!!</i> See my review for the course <a href="#">here</a>.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Z1P3LAbKP7wGJxkSXdrs5A_2Q_DxkjM7">ECON 101 and 102</a></h2>
        <p>Including this deck is kind of questionable because... uh... it's pretty messy. It's a combined deck for Micro and Macro. ECON 101 is covered in full, but the ECON 102 cards don't include content from the last several chapters (aka the point at which I gave up on the course). I didn't use tags to separate 101 and 102, which also makes it kind of a pain sorry :-(</p>
