    Waterloo courses I've taken. Some high school stuff here too.
    Flashcards are the easiest way for me to retain information. At
    this point, I don't take notes for my classes anymore. It's
    all flashcards all the way, baby. I use the Anki software to
    create and host them. Anki also allows sharing decks publicly,

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/707193547">AP BIOLOGY</a>.
          Actually this is a combined deck
          for both <b>AP Bio</b> and the <b>Alberta Bio 20/30</b> curriculum.
          There's a lot of overlap between these two courses and I was
          taking them simultaneously, so I didn't bother separating
          the two at the time.
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2026801846">CHEM 120</a>.
        <i>For CHEM 120 only, not CHEM 120L!!</i> (Although there is
          overlap between the finals, this deck does not provide
          comprehensive coverage of exam content for CHEM 123L.)
          See my review for the course <a href="/blog/#">here</a>.

  <p><i>
    I have a longing for life, and I go on living in spite of logic. Though I
    may not believe in the order of the universe, yet I love the sticky little
    leaves as they open in spring. I love the blue sky, I love some people,
    whom one loves you know sometimes without knowing why. I love some great
    deeds done by men, though I've long ceased perhaps to have faith in them,
    yet from old habit one's heart prizes them.
  </i></p>
  <p>&mdash; Fyodor Dostoevsky, "The Brothers Karamazov"</p>
