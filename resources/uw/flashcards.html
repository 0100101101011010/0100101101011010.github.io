    Waterloo courses I've taken. Some high school stuff here too.
    Flashcards are the easiest way for me to retain information. At
    this point, I don't take notes for my classes anymore. It's
    all flashcards all the way, baby. I use the Anki software to
    create and host them. Anki also allows sharing decks publicly,
    which is what I've done with some of the courses I've completed,
    as below." />

    <p>Flashcards are the easiest way for me to retain information. At
      this point, I don't take notes for my classes anymore. It's
      all flashcards all the way, baby. I use the Anki software to
      create them, so the links below are to .apkg files. If you have Anki
      downloaded on your computer, double-clicking the downloaded file should
      open them up automatically; if not, right-click and select "open with".

    <p>I know a lot of people prefer using Quizlet, and yeah there's a way to
      import these decks into Quizlet, although idk about what that'll do to
      the cards with images or cloze deletions. But <a href="/contact">message</a>
      me and I'll show you how to convert them!

      <li>
        <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/707193547">AP BIOLOGY (Advanced Placement)</a>.
          Actually this is a combined deck
          for both <b>AP Bio</b> and the <b>Alberta Bio 20/30</b> curriculum.
          There's a lot of overlap between these two courses and I was
          taking them simultaneously, so I didn't bother separating
          the two at the time.

      <li>
        <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yCA0ZcqaLL2erxBnNXiGx0CLMgl2a9qP">CHEM 120 (uWaterloo)</a>.
        <i>For CHEM 120 only, not CHEM 120L!!</i> (Although there is
        overlap between the finals, this deck does not provide
        comprehensive coverage of exam content for CHEM 123L.)
        See my review for the course <a href="/blog/2018/05/31/thoughts-on-my-1a-courses/">here</a>.

        <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Z1P3LAbKP7wGJxkSXdrs5A_2Q_DxkjM7">ECON 101 and 102 (uWaterloo)</a>.
        Including this deck is kind of questionable because... uh... it's pretty messy.
        It's a combined deck for Micro and Macro.
        It has everything you need to know for ECON 101, but the ECON 102 cards don't cover
        the last several chapters (aka the point at which I gave up in the course).
        I didn't use tags to separate 101 and 102, which also makes it kind of a pain sorry :-(
