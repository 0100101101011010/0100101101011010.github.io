## Chapter 1

### DATA VS INFORMATION

- data is collected, recorded, and stored, but *not organized or analyzed*
- information is data that has been organized to make a decision or explanation
- information overload = suffering from too much information, creating inefficiencies, reducing decision qualities
- IT is used to filter and condense information to focus on the meaningful bits

### WHAT MAKES INFORMATION USEFUL?

- relevant = information relates to your decision (ie. you need it to make the decision)
- reliable = if provided by a third party, would be considered reliable; if provided by the party you're dealing with themselves... not so much
- complete = does not omit any important aspects
- timely = info has to be up-to-date, current, related to the period you are dealing with
- understandable = presented in a meaningful manner
- verifiable = two independent parties can both produce the same information
- accessible = available when needed, in a useable format

### TYPES OF BUSINESS PROCESSES

a set of related, coordinated, and structured activities (ie. transactions) to achieve a goal

- revenue cycle = give goods or services → get cash
- expenditure cycle = receive goods or services → give cash
- production cycle = input labour + raw materials → get finished goods
- payroll cycle = give cash → get labour
- financing cycle = give cash → get cash

each kind of business process has different information needs (requires different kinds of useful information)

### AIS (ACCOUNTING INFORMATION SYSTEM)

![ais users](/resources/uw/images/ais.jpg){:width="100%"}

system that uses data to produce information for the decision makers, consisting of:

- who uses the system (from hourly employees to managers)
- processes to collect, store, process data
- technology to transform data into useful information
- controls to safeguard information and maintain its quality

### DATA PROCESSING CYCLE

![data processing cycle](/resources/uw/images/dataprocessingcycle.jpg){:width="50%"}

- data input
  - must collect data about three aspects of each business activity:
    1. what is the event (transaction)
    1. what is the resource (ie. asset like inventory, cash, equipment) affected by that activity
    1. who (ie. the user) participates in that activity
  - **source documents** collect the data (eg. time cards for recording how much time employees worked, purchase orders for recording items ordered)
- data storage
- information output
