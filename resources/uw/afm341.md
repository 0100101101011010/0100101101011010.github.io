## Chapter 1

### DATA VS INFORMATION

- data is collected, recorded, and stored, but *not organized or analyzed*
- information is data that has been organized to make a decision or explanation
- information overload = suffering from too much information, creating inefficiencies, reducing decision qualities
- IT is used to filter and condense information to focus on the meaningful bits

### WHAT MAKES INFORMATION USEFUL?

- relevant = information relates to your decision (ie. you need it to make the decision)
- reliable = if provided by a third party, would be considered reliable; if provided by the party you're dealing with themselves... not so much
- complete = does not omit any important aspects
- timely = info has to be up-to-date, current, related to the period you are dealing with
- understandable = presented in a meaningful manner
- verifiable = two independent parties can both produce the same information
- accessible = available when needed, in a useable format

### TYPES OF BUSINESS PROCESSES

a set of related, coordinated, and structured activities (ie. transactions) to achieve a goal

- revenue cycle = give goods or services → get cash
- expenditure cycle = receive goods or services → give cash
- production cycle = input labour + raw materials → get finished goods
- payroll cycle = give cash → get labour
- financing cycle = give cash → get cash

each kind of business process has different information needs (requires different kinds of useful information)

### AIS (ACCOUNTING INFORMATION SYSTEM)

![ais users](/resources/uw/images/ais.jpg){:width="100%"}

system that uses data to produce information for the decision makers, consisting of:

- who uses the system (from hourly employees to vendors to govt to mgmt)
- processes to collect, store, process data
- technology to transform data into useful information
- controls to safeguard information and maintain its quality

AIS adds value to the organization, and the organization's overall strategy influences how AIS is used, eg:

- walmart's strategy = cost leadership, thus uses AIS to focus on how to cut costs and lower prices
- apple's strategy = high quality, can use AIS to determine how to maintain quality while staying affordable
- niche market specialization

### VALUE CHAIN

- primary value chain activities
  - inbound logistics
  - marketing & sales
- secondary
  -

#### Sample Exam Question 2

*Identify three characteristics that make data 'useful.' For each characteristic, provide an example of how an organization could improve the usefulness of their data.*

- relevant:
- reliable:
complete, timely, understandable, verifiable, accessible

### ERP (ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING)

typically structured around modules, which are discrete sets of related business functions, eg. manufacturing; accounting; supply chain, etc. and businesses can pick and choose which modules they

- benefits:
  - centralized database (facilitates better flow of information between departments, less time wasted on communication)
  - centralized security (easier to prevent inappropriate user access)
  - standardized policies and procedures
- risks:
  - costly (and might even end up abandoned if you can't get it to work within your budget)
  - takes a lot of time
  - customizing or standardizing a business process may limit innovation
  - user resistance (can combat with incentives, training, gradual introduction)

eg. SAP, oracle, sage, 

### DATA PROCESSING CYCLE

![data processing cycle](/resources/uw/images/dataprocessingcycle.jpg){:width="50%"}

- data input
  - must collect data about three aspects of each business activity:
    1. what is the event (transaction)
    1. what is the resource (ie. asset like inventory, cash, equipment) affected by that activity
    1. who (ie. the user) participates in that activity
  - **source documents** collect the data (eg. time cards for recording how much time employees worked, purchase orders for recording items ordered)
- data storage
- information output
