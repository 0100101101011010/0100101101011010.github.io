## Class 1

### DATA VS INFORMATION

- data is collected, recorded, and stored, but *not organized or analyzed*
- information is data that has been organized to make a decision or explanation
- information overload = suffering from too much information, creating inefficiencies, reducing decision qualities
- IT is used to filter and condense information to focus on the meaningful bits

### WHAT MAKES INFORMATION USEFUL?

- relevant = information relates to your decision (ie. you need it to make the decision)
- reliable = if provided by a third party, would be considered reliable; if provided by the party you're dealing with themselves... not so much
- complete = does not omit any important aspects
- timely = info has to be up-to-date, current, related to the period you are dealing with
- understandable = presented in a meaningful manner
- verifiable = two independent parties can both produce the same information
- accessible = available when needed, in a useable format

### TYPES OF BUSINESS PROCESSES

a set of related, coordinated, and structured activities (ie. transactions) to achieve a goal

- revenue cycle = give goods or services → get cash
- expenditure cycle = receive goods or services → give cash
- production cycle = input labour + raw materials → get finished goods
- payroll cycle = give cash → get labour
- financing cycle = give cash → get cash

each kind of business process has different information needs (requires different kinds of useful information)

### AIS (ACCOUNTING INFORMATION SYSTEM)

![ais users](/resources/uw/images/ais.jpg){:width="100%"}

system that uses data to produce information for the decision makers, consisting of:

- who uses the system (from hourly employees to vendors to govt to mgmt)
- processes to collect, store, process data
- technology to transform data into useful information
- controls to safeguard information and maintain its quality

AIS adds value to the organization, and the organization's overall strategy influences how AIS is used, eg:

- walmart's strategy = cost leadership, thus uses AIS to focus on how to cut costs and lower prices
- apple's strategy = high quality, can use AIS to determine how to maintain quality while staying affordable
- niche market specialization

### VALUE CHAIN

- primary value chain activities
  - inbound logistics
  - marketing & sales
- secondary
  -

#### Sample Exam Question 1

*Which of the following statements below shows the contrast between data and information?*

1. *Data is the primary output of an accounting information system.*
1. *Information is the primary output of an accounting information system.*
1. *Data is more useful in decision making than information.*
1. *Data and information are the same.*

Correct answer: 2

#### Sample Exam Question 2

*Identify three characteristics that make data 'useful.' For each characteristic, provide an example of how an organization could improve the usefulness of their data.*

- relevant:
- reliable:
complete, timely, understandable, verifiable, accessible

### ERP (ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING)

typically structured around modules, which are discrete sets of related business functions, eg. manufacturing; accounting; supply chain, etc. and businesses can pick and choose which modules they

- benefits:
  - centralized database (facilitates better flow of information between departments, less time wasted on communication)
  - centralized security (easier to prevent inappropriate user access)
  - standardized policies and procedures
- risks:
  - costly (and might even end up abandoned if you can't get it to work within your budget)
  - takes a lot of time
  - customizing or standardizing a business process may limit innovation
  - user resistance (can combat with incentives, training, gradual introduction)

eg. SAP, oracle netsuite, sage, microsoft cloud-based dynamics, salesforce

### DATA PROCESSING CYCLE

![data processing cycle](/resources/uw/images/dataprocessingcycle.jpg){:width="50%"}

- data input
  - must collect data about three aspects of each business activity:
    1. what is the event (transaction)
    1. what is the resource (ie. asset like inventory, cash, equipment) affected by that activity
    1. who (ie. the user) participates in that activity
  - **source documents** collect the data (eg. time cards for recording how much time employees worked, purchase orders for recording items ordered)
- data storage
- information output

## Class 2

### DATABASES

= a group of data files that are all related

can think of it like a table.

- field = specific attribute of interest for the entity
  - eg. each column in a customer list (each of name, address, phone number, etc. for the same customer is a different field)
- record = related group of fields
  - eg. each row in a customer list (each customer along with their information like name, address, phone number, etc. is a different record)
- file = related group of records
  - eg. the entire list of multiple customers is a file

#### RELATIONAL DATABASES

several data tables can be connected based on a common element (a primary key)

examples: Access, DB2, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, SAP DB, SAP HANA Database

![relational data tables](/resources/uw/images/relationaldatatables.jpg){:width="100%"}

- primary key = unique identifier for a record (row)
  - eg. a sales invoice number or customer account number
  - eg. names are not a good primary key, because they can be repeated (aka two customers named John Smith), or changed (aka a customer gets married and changes last name)
  - ideally, a primary key will not change. otherwise you'd have to go to every instance of that key and update it to the new one
- foreign key = primary keys that are from another table
  - eg. customer # is the primary key of the Customer table, and is the foreign key for the Sales table

benefits of related tables:

- prevent redundancy → therefore increase efficiency, decrease storage space required
- prevent anomalies (these are common problems in using one big table to hold all information instead of a set of related tables):
  - update anomaly = an item is updated in one location but not another → inconsistencies in the table
  - insert anomaly = inability to add records to a database
  - delete anomaly = loss of all information about an entity when a row is deleted
    - eg. MATH course is only referenced in Richard's row, so if you delete him, then you also delete MATH from existence

#### QUERIES

= command you issue a database to be able to find a specific piece of information without having to waste time sorting through all the files

examples: SQL

#### Sample Exam Questions

*All of the following are advantages of an ERP system except*

1. in an ERP, data input is captured or keyed once.
1. ERPs permit management to gain greater visibility into every area of
the enterprise.
1. it takes considerable experience and training to use an ERP system
effectively.
1. ERPs permit manufacturing plants to receive new orders in real time.

Answer: C

*Describe what a relational database is, how it organizes data, and how to create a set of well-structured relational database tables.*

## Class 3

### SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE (SDLC)

1. systems analysis
  - brainstorm. do user research: ask users of current pains, what could be improved, what new features they want to see
1. feasibility analysis
  - can it be done on time?
  - can it be done for [budget] amount of money?
  - do the proposed changes complie with laws?
  - do the benefits justify the means?
1. conceptual design
1. feasibility analysis
1. physical design
1. feasibility analysis
1. implementation and conversion
1. feasibility analysis
1. operations and maintenance
  - keep system running smoothly
  - keep thinking of how to improve
  - ask, "is our current system able to accommodate [upcoming changes]?"
1. rinse, repeat

![sdlc](/resources/uw/images/sdlc.jpg){:width="100%"}

two plans are involved in a SDLC:

1. project development plan
  - specific for a project
1. master plan
  - long-term plan, like a road map for the future, 10–20 year period

two tools commonly used in SDLC:

1. PERT (program evaluation and review technique): tree diagram that shows all project activities and the time, resource, completion estimates
1. gantt chart: bar chart that organizes and tracks progress of activities

![pert](/resources/uw/images/pert.jpg){:width="50%"}
![gantt](/resources/uw/images/gantt.jpg){:width="50%"}

capital budgeting formulas used in feasibility analysis:

- payback period
- NPV
  - pros: can screen totally impossible projects that would result in a big negative NPV
  - cons: can be hard to accurately project future cash flows
- IRR
  - pros: simple to calculate, gives you fairly accurate answer
  - cons: hard to calculate for projects with inconsistent cash flows

### FAILED IT PROJECTS

the triple constraint (generally must sacrifice at least one to achieve others):

- time
- cost
- scope

top reasons why IT project falls behind schedule or fails:

1. poor planning or poor project mgmt
1. change in goals halfway thru project
1. lack of support from business mgmt

risk factors:

- complexity
- clarity
- size

consequences:

- damage to brand reputation
- customers and employees lose confidence
- waste of money
- waste of employee resources and time, lowering efficiency

#### MITIGATING RISKS

### OBTAINING AN AIS

- purchase: best where speed is important, and competitive advantage is not required
  - aka "canned," "turnkey," or "off-the-shelf"
  - more and more common thanks to cloud computing (where servers can be stored on site)
  - steps:
    - select a vendor
    - request for proposal (RFP), and await bids
    - evaluate proposals
    - make selection
- develop in-house: best if specialized knowledge is required and competitive advantage is desired
  - may be necessary if you are in a niche where you can't purchase a software to suit your needs (these days it's getting rarer and rarer that this is the case)
  - only if your company has the existing talent to do it themselves
  - however, requires more time than purchasing an existing software, and relies on accurate requirements definitions, etc.
  - you bear all the [risks of a typical IT project](#failed-it-projects)
- outsource: best if you want some degree of competitive advantage from the software, but your internal skills are limited
  - hire a third party to assist, if your company has limited internal specialty
  - however, you're relying on a third party who may provide poor service

### SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGIES

= a collection of concepts and approaches to guide the building of a software system

two main methodologies:

- waterfall (aka traditional, structured): best to use when building something very large and complex, eg. audit software
  - each phase of the SDLC occurs in *very discrete steps*
    - every phase has to be drilled down and defined to the nitty gritty details
  - cannot move on to next step until previous step is totally done
  - however, can be costly, time-consuming, and inflexible
    - eg. if a sign-off is required at each step, what if that signer goes on vacation? → wasted time
  - emphasizes sign-offs and formalized written documents
  - considered quite old-school now
- agile (aka iterative): best to use for smaller projects, eg. a to-do app
  - examples: scrum, crystal methods, lean software dev
  - release software in Versions, starting with Version 1 a very basic release; each version including some improvement arrived at based on user feedback
  - work is done in increments ("sprints")
  - emphasizes face-to-face communication, increased collaboration between developer and customer
  - can minimize scope creep (because you only have a very short time period for each sprint, therefore reducing how much work you think you can take on at once)
  - doesn't work for all projects, esp large, complex software (where a lot of components are required to work up front in order for software to be useful)

![waterfall](/resources/uw/images/waterfall.jpg){:width="50%"} ![agile](/resources/uw/images/agile.jpg){:width="50%"}

#### Sample Exam Questions

*What is the correct sequence of the phases in the systems development life cycle?*

1. *Conceptual design, physical design, system analysis, implementation and conversion, and operations and maintenance.*
1. *Operations and maintenance, conceptual design, system analysis, physical design, implementation and conversion.*
1. *System analysis, conceptual design, physical design, implementation and conversion, and operations and maintenance.*
1. *System analysis, physical design, conceptual design, and operations and maintenance, implementation and conversion.*

Answer: C

*Firms should consider developing custom software only if*

1. it will be used for critical functions like accounts receivable.
1. it will contribute to development of a significant competitive advantage.
1. the firm has the necessary expertise available in-house.
1. the available canned software is very expensive

Best answer is B, could also argue for C (but could argue that the company can simply hire the necessary talent)

## Class 4

### SYSTEMS DOCUMENTATION

#### DATA FLOW DIAGRAMS (DFDs)

= graphical representation of how data flows in an organization

![dfd](/resources/uw/images/dfd.jpg){:width="100%"}

- data sources and destinations (squares) =
- data flows (arrows) =
- transformation processes (circles) =
- data store = a large collection of data (eg. a simple spreadsheet does not count as a data store)
- internal control (triangles) =

context diagram = the highest level view, a summary of the entire system:

![context diagram dfd](/resources/uw/images/dfdcontext.jpg){:width="100%"}

you can then drill down to more focused levels.

eg. "level 0 DFD":

![level 0 dfd](/resources/uw/images/dfd0.jpg){:width="100%"}

eg. "level 1 DFD":

![level 1 dfd](/resources/uw/images/dfd1.jpg){:width="100%"}

DFDs are governed by a global body, thus they should be universally understood.

tools for creating DFDs:

- draw.io
- creately
