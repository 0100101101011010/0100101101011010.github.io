### DATA PROCESSING CYCLE

- data input
  - must collect data about three aspects of each business activity:
    1. what is the activity
    1. what is the resource affected by that activity
    1. who participates in that activity
  - types of data are collected on source documents (eg. time cards for recording how much time employees worked, purchase orders for recording items ordered)
- data storage
