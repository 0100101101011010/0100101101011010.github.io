## Class 1

### DATA VS INFORMATION

- data is collected, recorded, and stored, but *not organized or analyzed*
- information is data that has been organized to make a decision or explanation
- information overload = suffering from too much information, creating inefficiencies, reducing decision qualities
- IT is used to filter and condense information to focus on the meaningful bits

### WHAT MAKES INFORMATION USEFUL?

- relevant = information relates to your decision (ie. you need it to make the decision)
- reliable = if provided by a third party, would be considered reliable; if provided by the party you're dealing with themselves... not so much
- complete = does not omit any important aspects
- timely = info has to be up-to-date, current, related to the period you are dealing with
- understandable = presented in a meaningful manner
- verifiable = two independent parties can both produce the same information
- accessible = available when needed, in a useable format

### TYPES OF BUSINESS PROCESSES

a set of related, coordinated, and structured activities (ie. transactions) to achieve a goal

- revenue cycle = give goods or services → get cash
- expenditure cycle = receive goods or services → give cash
- production cycle = input labour + raw materials → get finished goods
- payroll cycle = give cash → get labour
- financing cycle = give cash → get cash

each kind of business process has different information needs (requires different kinds of useful information)

### AIS (ACCOUNTING INFORMATION SYSTEM)

![ais users](/resources/uw/images/ais.jpg){:width="100%"}

system that uses data to produce information for the decision makers, consisting of:

- who uses the system (from hourly employees to vendors to govt to mgmt)
- processes to collect, store, process data
- technology to transform data into useful information
- controls to safeguard information and maintain its quality

AIS adds value to the organization, and the organization's overall strategy influences how AIS is used, eg:

- walmart's strategy = cost leadership, thus uses AIS to focus on how to cut costs and lower prices
- apple's strategy = high quality, can use AIS to determine how to maintain quality while staying affordable
- niche market specialization

### VALUE CHAIN

- primary value chain activities
  - inbound logistics
  - marketing & sales
- secondary
  -

#### Sample Exam Question 1

*Which of the following statements below shows the contrast between data and information?*

1. *Data is the primary output of an accounting information system.*
1. *Information is the primary output of an accounting information system.*
1. *Data is more useful in decision making than information.*
1. *Data and information are the same.*

Correct answer: 2

#### Sample Exam Question 2

*Identify three characteristics that make data 'useful.' For each characteristic, provide an example of how an organization could improve the usefulness of their data.*

- relevant:
- reliable:
complete, timely, understandable, verifiable, accessible

### ERP (ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING)

typically structured around modules, which are discrete sets of related business functions, eg. manufacturing; accounting; supply chain, etc. and businesses can pick and choose which modules they

- benefits:
  - centralized database (facilitates better flow of information between departments, less time wasted on communication)
  - centralized security (easier to prevent inappropriate user access)
  - standardized policies and procedures
- risks:
  - costly (and might even end up abandoned if you can't get it to work within your budget)
  - takes a lot of time
  - customizing or standardizing a business process may limit innovation
  - user resistance (can combat with incentives, training, gradual introduction)

eg. SAP, oracle netsuite, sage, microsoft cloud-based dynamics, salesforce

### DATA PROCESSING CYCLE

![data processing cycle](/resources/uw/images/dataprocessingcycle.jpg){:width="50%"}

- data input
  - must collect data about three aspects of each business activity:
    1. what is the event (transaction)
    1. what is the resource (ie. asset like inventory, cash, equipment) affected by that activity
    1. who (ie. the user) participates in that activity
  - **source documents** collect the data (eg. time cards for recording how much time employees worked, purchase orders for recording items ordered)
- data storage
- information output

## Class 2

### DATABASES

= a group of data files that are all related

can think of it like a table.

- field = specific attribute of interest for the entity
  - eg. each column in a customer list (each of name, address, phone number, etc. for the same customer is a different field)
- record = related group of fields
  - eg. each row in a customer list (each customer along with their information like name, address, phone number, etc. is a different record)
- file = related group of records
  - eg. the entire list of multiple customers is a file

#### RELATIONAL DATABASES

several data tables can be connected based on a common element (a primary key)

examples: Access, DB2, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, SAP DB, SAP HANA Database

![relational data tables](/resources/uw/images/relationaldatatables.jpg){:width="100%"}

- primary key = unique identifier for a record (row)
  - eg. a sales invoice number or customer account number
  - eg. names are not a good primary key, because they can be repeated (aka two customers named John Smith), or changed (aka a customer gets married and changes last name)
  - ideally, a primary key will not change. otherwise you'd have to go to every instance of that key and update it to the new one
- foreign key = primary keys that are from another table
  - eg. customer # is the primary key of the Customer table, and is the foreign key for the Sales table

benefits of related tables:

- prevent redundancy → therefore increase efficiency, decrease storage space required
- prevent anomalies (these are common problems in using one big table to hold all information instead of a set of related tables):
  - update anomaly = an item is updated in one location but not another → inconsistencies in the table
  - insert anomaly = inability to add records to a database
  - delete anomaly = loss of all information about an entity when a row is deleted
    - eg. MATH course is only referenced in Richard's row, so if you delete him, then you also delete MATH from existence

#### QUERIES

= command you issue a database to be able to find a specific piece of information without having to waste time sorting through all the files

examples: SQL

#### Sample Exam Questions

*All of the following are advantages of an ERP system except*

1. in an ERP, data input is captured or keyed once.
1. ERPs permit management to gain greater visibility into every area of
the enterprise.
1. it takes considerable experience and training to use an ERP system
effectively.
1. ERPs permit manufacturing plants to receive new orders in real time.

Answer: C

*Describe what a relational database is, how it organizes data, and how to create a set of well-structured relational database tables.*
