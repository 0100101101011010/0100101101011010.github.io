## Class 1

### DATA VS INFORMATION

- data is collected, recorded, and stored, but *not organized or analyzed*
- information is data that has been organized to make a decision or explanation
- information overload = suffering from too much information, creating inefficiencies, reducing decision qualities
- IT is used to filter and condense information to focus on the meaningful bits

### WHAT MAKES INFORMATION USEFUL?

- relevant = information relates to your decision (ie. you need it to make the decision)
- reliable = if provided by a third party, would be considered reliable; if provided by the party you're dealing with themselves... not so much
- complete = does not omit any important aspects
- timely = info has to be up-to-date, current, related to the period you are dealing with
- understandable = presented in a meaningful manner
- verifiable = two independent parties can both produce the same information
- accessible = available when needed, in a useable format

### TYPES OF BUSINESS PROCESSES

a set of related, coordinated, and structured activities (ie. transactions) to achieve a goal

- revenue cycle = give goods or services → get cash
- expenditure cycle = receive goods or services → give cash
- production cycle = input labour + raw materials → get finished goods
- payroll cycle = give cash → get labour
- financing cycle = give cash → get cash

each kind of business process has different information needs (requires different kinds of useful information)

### AIS (ACCOUNTING INFORMATION SYSTEM)

![ais users](/resources/uw/images/ais.jpg){:width="100%"}

system that uses data to produce information for the decision makers, consisting of:

- who uses the system (from hourly employees to vendors to govt to mgmt)
- processes to collect, store, process data
- technology to transform data into useful information
- controls to safeguard information and maintain its quality

AIS adds value to the organization, and the organization's overall strategy influences how AIS is used, eg:

- walmart's strategy = cost leadership, thus uses AIS to focus on how to cut costs and lower prices
- apple's strategy = high quality, can use AIS to determine how to maintain quality while staying affordable
- niche market specialization

### VALUE CHAIN

- primary value chain activities
  - inbound logistics
  - marketing & sales
- secondary
  -

#### Sample Exam Question 1

*Which of the following statements below shows the contrast between data and information?*

1. *Data is the primary output of an accounting information system.*
1. *Information is the primary output of an accounting information system.*
1. *Data is more useful in decision making than information.*
1. *Data and information are the same.*

Correct answer: 2

#### Sample Exam Question 2

*Identify three characteristics that make data 'useful.' For each characteristic, provide an example of how an organization could improve the usefulness of their data.*

- relevant:
- reliable:
complete, timely, understandable, verifiable, accessible

### ERP (ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING)

typically structured around modules, which are discrete sets of related business functions, eg. manufacturing; accounting; supply chain, etc. and businesses can pick and choose which modules they

- benefits:
  - centralized database (facilitates better flow of information between departments, less time wasted on communication)
  - centralized security (easier to prevent inappropriate user access)
  - standardized policies and procedures
- risks:
  - costly (and might even end up abandoned if you can't get it to work within your budget)
  - takes a lot of time
  - customizing or standardizing a business process may limit innovation
  - user resistance (can combat with incentives, training, gradual introduction)

eg. SAP, oracle netsuite, sage, microsoft cloud-based dynamics, salesforce

### DATA PROCESSING CYCLE

![data processing cycle](/resources/uw/images/dataprocessingcycle.jpg){:width="50%"}

- data input
  - must collect data about three aspects of each business activity:
    1. what is the event (transaction)
    1. what is the resource (ie. asset like inventory, cash, equipment) affected by that activity
    1. who (ie. the user) participates in that activity
  - **source documents** collect the data (eg. time cards for recording how much time employees worked, purchase orders for recording items ordered)
- data storage
- information output

## Class 2

### DATABASES

= a group of data files that are all related

can think of it like a table.

- field = specific attribute of interest for the entity
  - eg. each column in a customer list (each of name, address, phone number, etc. for the same customer is a different field)
- record = related group of fields
  - eg. each row in a customer list (each customer along with their information like name, address, phone number, etc. is a different record)
- file = related group of records
  - eg. the entire list of multiple customers is a file

#### RELATIONAL DATABASES

several data tables can be connected based on a common element (a primary key)

examples: Access, DB2, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, SAP DB, SAP HANA Database

![relational data tables](/resources/uw/images/relationaldatatables.jpg){:width="100%"}

- primary key = unique identifier for a record (row)
  - eg. a sales invoice number or customer account number
  - eg. names are not a good primary key, because they can be repeated (aka two customers named John Smith), or changed (aka a customer gets married and changes last name)
  - ideally, a primary key will not change. otherwise you'd have to go to every instance of that key and update it to the new one
- foreign key = primary keys that are from another table
  - eg. customer # is the primary key of the Customer table, and is the foreign key for the Sales table

benefits of related tables:

- prevent redundancy → therefore increase efficiency, decrease storage space required
- prevent anomalies (these are common problems in using one big table to hold all information instead of a set of related tables):
  - update anomaly = an item is updated in one location but not another → inconsistencies in the table
  - insert anomaly = inability to add records to a database
  - delete anomaly = loss of all information about an entity when a row is deleted
    - eg. MATH course is only referenced in Richard's row, so if you delete him, then you also delete MATH from existence

#### QUERIES

= command you issue a database to be able to find a specific piece of information without having to waste time sorting through all the files

examples: SQL

#### Sample Exam Questions

*All of the following are advantages of an ERP system except*

1. in an ERP, data input is captured or keyed once.
1. ERPs permit management to gain greater visibility into every area of
the enterprise.
1. it takes considerable experience and training to use an ERP system
effectively.
1. ERPs permit manufacturing plants to receive new orders in real time.

Answer: C

*Describe what a relational database is, how it organizes data, and how to create a set of well-structured relational database tables.*

## Class 3

### SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE (SDLC)

1. systems analysis
  - brainstorm. do user research: ask users of current pains, what could be improved, what new features they want to see
1. feasibility analysis
  - can it be done on time?
  - can it be done for [budget] amount of money?
  - do the proposed changes complie with laws?
  - do the benefits justify the means?
1. conceptual design
1. feasibility analysis
1. physical design
1. feasibility analysis
1. implementation and conversion
1. feasibility analysis
1. operations and maintenance
  - keep system running smoothly
  - keep thinking of how to improve
  - ask, "is our current system able to accommodate [upcoming changes]?"
1. rinse, repeat

![sdlc](/resources/uw/images/sdlc.jpg){:width="100%"}

two plans are involved in a SDLC:

1. project development plan
  - specific for a project
1. master plan
  - long-term plan, like a road map for the future, 10–20 year period

two tools commonly used in SDLC:

1. PERT (program evaluation and review technique): tree diagram that shows all project activities and the time, resource, completion estimates
1. gantt chart: bar chart that organizes and tracks progress of activities

![pert](/resources/uw/images/pert.jpg){:width="50%"}
![gantt](/resources/uw/images/gantt.jpg){:width="50%"}

capital budgeting formulas used in feasibility analysis:

- payback period
- NPV
  - pros: can screen totally impossible projects that would result in a big negative NPV
  - cons: can be hard to accurately project future cash flows
- IRR
  - pros: simple to calculate, gives you fairly accurate answer
  - cons: hard to calculate for projects with inconsistent cash flows

### FAILED IT PROJECTS

the triple constraint (generally must sacrifice at least one to achieve others):

- time
- cost
- scope

top reasons why IT project falls behind schedule or fails:

1. poor planning or poor project mgmt
1. change in goals halfway thru project
1. lack of support from business mgmt

risk factors:

- complexity
- clarity
- size

consequences:

- damage to brand reputation
- customers and employees lose confidence
- waste of money
- waste of employee resources and time, lowering efficiency

#### MITIGATING RISKS

### OBTAINING AN AIS

- purchase: best where speed is important, and competitive advantage is not required
  - aka "canned," "turnkey," or "off-the-shelf"
  - more and more common thanks to cloud computing (where servers can be stored on site)
  - steps:
    - select a vendor
    - request for proposal (RFP), and await bids
    - evaluate proposals
    - make selection
- develop in-house: best if specialized knowledge is required and competitive advantage is desired
  - may be necessary if you are in a niche where you can't purchase a software to suit your needs (these days it's getting rarer and rarer that this is the case)
  - only if your company has the existing talent to do it themselves
  - however, requires more time than purchasing an existing software, and relies on accurate requirements definitions, etc.
  - you bear all the [risks of a typical IT project](#failed-it-projects)
- outsource: best if you want some degree of competitive advantage from the software, but your internal skills are limited
  - hire a third party to assist, if your company has limited internal specialty
  - however, you're relying on a third party who may provide poor service

### SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGIES

= a collection of concepts and approaches to guide the building of a software system

two main methodologies:

- waterfall (aka traditional, structured): best to use when building something very large and complex, eg. audit software
  - each phase of the SDLC occurs in *very discrete steps*
    - every phase has to be drilled down and defined to the nitty gritty details
  - cannot move on to next step until previous step is totally done
  - however, can be costly, time-consuming, and inflexible
    - eg. if a sign-off is required at each step, what if that signer goes on vacation? → wasted time
  - emphasizes sign-offs and formalized written documents
  - considered quite old-school now
- agile (aka iterative): best to use for smaller projects, eg. a to-do app
  - examples: scrum, crystal methods, lean software dev
  - release software in Versions, starting with Version 1 a very basic release; each version including some improvement arrived at based on user feedback
  - work is done in increments ("sprints")
  - emphasizes face-to-face communication, increased collaboration between developer and customer
  - can minimize scope creep (because you only have a very short time period for each sprint, therefore reducing how much work you think you can take on at once)
  - doesn't work for all projects, esp large, complex software (where a lot of components are required to work up front in order for software to be useful)

![waterfall](/resources/uw/images/waterfall.jpg){:width="50%"} ![agile](/resources/uw/images/agile.jpg){:width="50%"}

#### Sample Exam Questions

*What is the correct sequence of the phases in the systems development life cycle?*

1. *Conceptual design, physical design, system analysis, implementation and conversion, and operations and maintenance.*
1. *Operations and maintenance, conceptual design, system analysis, physical design, implementation and conversion.*
1. *System analysis, conceptual design, physical design, implementation and conversion, and operations and maintenance.*
1. *System analysis, physical design, conceptual design, and operations and maintenance, implementation and conversion.*

Answer: C

*Firms should consider developing custom software only if*

1. it will be used for critical functions like accounts receivable.
1. it will contribute to development of a significant competitive advantage.
1. the firm has the necessary expertise available in-house.
1. the available canned software is very expensive

Best answer is B, could also argue for C (but could argue that the company can simply hire the necessary talent)

## Class 4

### SYSTEMS DOCUMENTATION

#### DATA FLOW DIAGRAMS (DFDs)

= graphical representation of how data flows in an organization

![dfd](/resources/uw/images/dfd.jpg){:width="100%"}

- data sources and destinations (squares) =
- data flows (arrows) =
- transformation processes (circles) =
- data store = a large collection of data (eg. a simple spreadsheet does not count as a data store)
- internal control (triangles) =

context diagram = the highest level view, a summary of the entire system:

![context diagram dfd](/resources/uw/images/dfdcontext.jpg){:width="100%"}

you can then drill down to more focused levels.

eg. "level 0 DFD":

![level 0 dfd](/resources/uw/images/dfd0.jpg){:width="100%"}

eg. "level 1 DFD":

![level 1 dfd](/resources/uw/images/dfd1.jpg){:width="100%"}

DFDs are governed by a global body, thus they should be universally understood.

tools for creating DFDs:

- draw.io
- creately

#### FLOWCHARTS

#### BUSINESS PROCESS DIAGRAMS

## Class 5

## Class 7

pillars of systems reliability:

- confidentiality
- privacy
- processing integrity
- availability

all of these pillars together form *security*

types of controls:

- preventive controls = aim to prevent incident from happening
  - training, workplace culture
    - *people* are #1 security risk (machines don't make mistakes, people do)
    - tone is set at the top, with how mgmt does things
    - eg. don't share passwords, protect against social engineering, download only from approved sources
  - authentication (five categories of options)
    - something you know, eg. password, pin
      - single sign-on (eg. 1password, google suite of services) allows users to authenticate once, which allows access to several applications: saves time and prevents having to memorize tons of passwords, but single point of failure
      - complexity requirements only allow passwords that fit the requirements (eg. 6+ characters): eliminates guessable passwords but encourages passwords to only fulfill minimum standard
      - password expiry requires users to change password every few months
      - employee training and awareness: reminds employees of good password hygiene but employees may tune out if reminders are too frequent
    - something you are, eg. biometrics (fingerprinting, iris scanning, voice recognition)
    - something you have, eg. fob, security pass
    - something you do, eg. pattern swiping
    - where you are, eg. IP address
  - authorization (only allowing people who need access to have access to a certain level of information)
  - IT solutions
    - firewall
    - encryption
      - cryptography is the study of maintaining confidentiality and integrity of information
      - encryption starts with plaintext, uses an algorithm and an encryption key (instructions to decode) to transform plaintext to ciphertext; to decrypt, use the same encryption key to do reverse process to convert back to plaintext
      - longer key is stronger
      - over time, the algorithms used in encryption have vulnerabilities (found by hackers trying to break in), so they are constantly replaced (eg. TJX used an out-of-date algorithm, and hackers stole $94 million credit card numbers).
      - symmetric encryption uses 1 shared key to both encrypt and decrypt
        - challenge: must keep shared key private
        - each of your trading partners requires a different key
      - asymmetric encryption uses a public key (everyone has access) and a private key (known only by recipient)
        - public key can be used by all your trading partners
        - private key can only be known by you to ensure no one else can read their message (and they can't read each other's messages amongst themselves)
        - can create digital signatures
      - vpn = a way to securely transmit encrypted data, also a preventive control.
  - physical security
- detective controls
  - log analysis = examining logs to identify evidence of possible attacks
    - eg. keywords in emails, bank account transactions
  - intrusion detection systems
    - log network traffic that was permitted to pass the firewall, then analyzes the log and flags signs of intrusion (or attempted intrusion)
- reactive/response controls = control and limit damage after an incident occurs, conduct investigations, recover and restore normal operations
  - for responding to an event *after* it has happened
  - computer incident response team (CIRT) is usually your IT team, they're responsible for dealing with incidents
  - steps:
    1. recognition (something has gone wrong)
      - proactive detection: vulnerability scanning, network scanning, antivirus, security audits
      - reactive detection: reports from users of unusual activity
    1. containment (mitigate damage done or will be done)
      - need to prioritize well to deal with different affected components
      1. technical response: collect data for analysis
      1. mgmt response: n
      1. legal response: dealing with potential lawsuits or other legal issues arising from incident
    1. recovery (restoring normal operations)
      - eradicate malware
      - deploy patches
      - restoring data (from backups)
      - forensics investigations
    1. follow-up (how do we prevent this from happening again?)
      - evaluating effectiveness of response
      - criteria for measuirng effectiveness:
        - total # of reported incidents
        - total # of detected incidents
        - avg time to resolve incidents
        - total savings from potential damages from incidents
        - total labour responding to incidents
    - incident response playbook = every company uses a playbook to guide response activities (eg. "if x happens, do y")

## Class 8

### CASE STUDY: CYBER BREACH AT TARGET

was target relaxed or unlucky?

- relaxed:
  - did not take all alerts from India team seriously or respond to them
  - did not have properly structured network (not segmented)
- unlucky:
  - they happened to choose a vendor with poor security practices
  - they did do spot checks, but just happened to miss the real threats

strengths of target's cybersecurity organizational structure:

- a 24/7 team in India that monitors attacks
- security system that automatically deletes detected malware

weaknesses of the organizational structure:

- false positives from the fireeye team
- poor vetting of its service providers (Fazio had weak security)
- lack of follow-up on Sept 2013 identified vulnerabilities
- lack of two-factor authentication
- network was not properly segmented so hackers could jump directly from the network for vendors to the network for customer data

contribution to the initial lack of action:

- did not take fireeye alert seriously (lack of communication between india and US team, and accustomed to false postives)
- the malware deletion system had been turned off

why was the CEO not informed for 3 days after FBI alert?

-


what could've been done better:

missteps once they knew of the breach:

- did not make public right away

should the directors be re-elected?

lessons to take away:

#### Sample Exam Question



- regular security checks
- effective internal controls
- create a culture of security awareness, starting at the top
- establish a manager to oversee the whole security system—increases accountability and ownership

## Class 9

### SIMULATION: CYBER ATTACK

in case of a sudden attack:

- refer to playbook
- preserve environment (no panicked emergency shutdowns)
- filter out distractions (know what things people are saying to you are relevant or not)
- draw on the resources and knowledge of your team
- try different things to see how they react with the attack (eg. reboot, trying to solve it in different ways)

how to make statements:

- avoid inherently scary words
- keep it truthful
- don't say anymore than you have to
- avoid statements that invite follow up questions
- avoid challenging hackers to attack again

## Class 10

### IT OPERATIONS

there often is no single department for all IT operations in a company; they are spread around in various departments and subunits

- IT help desk (ticketing and resolution)
- facilities mgmt (eg. backup power generators)
- systems development (eg. designing good forms that reduce user input error)
- security (eg. maintaining backups)
- HR (record of employees for user acct mgmt - removing old employee accounts, etc.)

### PROCESS INTEGRITY CONTROLS

data with integrity is free from errors, not tampered with, reliable, etc.

- input controls
  - eg. automatically adding an ID number to all data rows, so can easily see if a line is missing
- data entry controls = checking that data entered is correct
  - eg. checking it's the proper type: can't enter letters into the phone number fields, email addres fields must contain an "@"
  - eg. checking it's complete: phone number must contain at least 10 digits
- processing control
  - eg. an invoice can't be paid unless the purchase order, vendor invoice, and goods receipt are all matching and consistent with one another
- output control
  - eg. data transmission controls (checksums) ensure that all data sent to another database is received

### BACKUP PROCEDURES

- incremental backups: backs up data that have changed since the last *partial* backup
- differential backups: backs up data that have changed since the last *full* backup

where to store:

- removable media (USB, etc.) stored onsite (usually in a locked, fireproof safe)
- removable media stored offsite (eg. at another office or an outsourced service provider like Iron Mountain)
- remotely backup to an offsite location (separate data centre, like Google Drive, iCloud, etc.)

key considerations:

- regularly test removable media to see it remains [reliable](#hardware-lifecycle-management) (it's physically intact)
  - replace media on a set schedule (data stored on a USB only lasts max 60 years)
- regularly evaluate system environment to ensure all required systems are backed up
- employees are familiar with procedure to restore from backup

### HARDWARE LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT

- most IT hardware has a defined period during which it is considered highly reliable (after that, risk of random failure is higher and higher)
- IT operations team should keep a detailed list of when each piece of hardware was installed and when it should be replaced
- ensure proper environmental conditions are maintained (temperature, humidity, etc.)

### PHYSICAL CONTROLS

= *physical* protection of people, equipment, and data; separate from logical controls (*technical* protection)

physical threats:

- natural: earthquake, flood, fire
  - hurricanes may damage a company's data centres
  - forest fires are an issue to a lumber company
- system/technical: hardware outage, system error
  - banks, accounting firms susceptible to system breakdowns (especially during busy season! :0)
- man-made: explosion, toxic spill
  - natural resource companies (BP oil spill, gas leak, nuclear plant explosion, etc.)
- public health: pandemic
  - hospitals
- political instability: civil disturbances, strikes
  - mining companies based in foreign countries with unstable political climates
- supply systems: communication outages, power distribution interruptions

three types:

- disaster recovery and business continuity
- environmental controls
- physical access control
  - prevent people from being where they shouldn't be
  - prevent access to information that shouldn't be accessed by the wrong ppl

controls:

- communicate expectations
  - eg. clear policies made known to employees about who can enter which facilities
- preventive controls
  - eg. requiring key, card or biometric access to certain rooms
- detective controls
  - eg. earthquake monitoring systems, temperature monitoring systems (if breaches a threshold, the system notifies mgmt)
- corrective controls
  - eg. if power fails, turn on backup power generator
    - UPS (uninterruptible power supply) provides just a few minutes of power to allow staff to shut down systems in an orderly fashion
    - a diesel-powered, backup source of power that is auto-engaged when main power becomes unavailable
  - eg. old hard drives should be periodically tested, transferred to new drive when they're old, then destroyed

### BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLAN / DISASTER RECOVERY PLAN

  1. team members
  1. responsibilities
  1. emergency procedures
  1. ...

- mirror site = exact mirror image, redundant, of the actual data centre
- hot site = fully configured data centre with all required components
- warm site = mostly configured data centre, missing some of the more complex components
- cold site = physical space for a data centre, but no technicaly equipment

# MIDTERM INCLUDES ALL OF THE ABOVE

## Class 12

- preventive controls
  - segregation of duties
- detective controls
- corrective controls
  - business continuity plan (not always just in case of disaster. eg. migrating to a new office location)
  - software patches

- standard = rules that you have to adhere to (you must meet it if doing a task)
- framework = broad conceptual guidance (helps you accomplish a task)

### ISO 20000

- Who published/sponsored the framework/standard?
  - a subcommittee of the ISO/EIC Joint Technical Committee
  - A joint committee by the:
    - International Organization for Standardization = international standard-setting body, which promotes globally consistent standards in the business world. This helps facilitate global trade by making standards consistent and easier to understand between different countries.
    - International Electrotechnical Commission is also international, it sets standards related to electric and electronic technologies
- What is the framework/standard used for?
- What are its key components?
- In what kind of engagement (audit, consulting, etc.) could the
framework/standard be employed?

### COBIT version 6

= an IT audit based framework for IT compliance, with steps for an organization to follow to implement a new system or control, or evaluating existing controls

separates into 2 broad groups, with 40 total processes (each connected with a goal in mind, like mgmt practice, law compliance, etc.), further categorized into five domains:

- management = day-to-day operations
  - align, plan, organize
  - build, acquire, implement
  - deliver, service, support
  - monitor, evaluate, assess
- governance = broadly oversees entire operation
  - evaluate, direct, monitor

timeline of goals: stakeholder drivers and needs → enterprise goals → alignment goals → governance and mgmt goals

responsible vs accountable:

- many people can be *responsible* for a task, but if something goes wrong...
- one person (typically CTO, etc.) is held *accountable* for the failure
- basically, if you screw up, you may pass the ultimate blame onto the *accountable* person

why is COBIT used?

- keeping the data safe
- reducing service downtime
- increasing shareholder confidence (can be more comfortable knowing that the controls are effective)
- end-to-end company coverage
- a single, comprehensive solution (instead of having to piece together several frameworks)

disadvantages:

- may be considered too costly, constraining, bureaucratic (as an auditor, you need to exercise professional judgement; shouldn't follow everything prescribed in the standard to the letter)
- very detailed, complex

common use cases:

- by management for specific guidance for designing new controls
- by IT auditors to test for the relevant and important controls

### SOC reports (service organization controls)

- when you are providing service to another business, they would like to see you are SOC compliant to increase their confidence in you

3 reporting options:

1. SOC 1 = SSAE 16 = internal controls related to reporting
1. SOC 2 = internal controls related to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, privacy
  - same as SOC 3 but access is restricted; can only obtain through requesting it
  - report content:
    - organization and management (like an org chart)
    - communications
    - risk management
    - monitoring of controls
    - logical and physical access controls = ensuring systems do the right things; correctly authorization levels; can an unauthorized person gain access to secured areas?
    - system operations
    - change mgmt = how are employees informed of a change in mgmt? what steps are taken when people change?
  - new addition: "SOC for cybersecurity" similar to SOC 2 but has some slight differences
    - focuses on the entity's cyber risk management program
    - intended users: mgmt, direactors, and general users (investors)
1. SOC 3 = same as SOC 2 but unrestricted

could your service organization affect a client's financial reporting? SOC 1
(if any of the services provided by you impact a client's financial statements)

does your service organization want to be evaluated on the trust service principles? SOC 2 and SOC 3

is there restricted use?
if only intended to be read by user organizations that rely on your services, use SOC 1 and 2, otherwise use 3

two types (a SOC 1 can be either type, so can a SOC 2):

1. type 1 = covers a single point in time
1. type 2 = covers a period (6 consecutive months)

## Sample Exam Problem

1. D
1. zz
1. SOC 2 is restricted access (only available to user organizations that you are providing services to), SOC 3 is unrestricted access; (part 2 of the question) SOC 2
