** Exam mostly focuses on calculations and deadlines

## L1: RIGHTS & OBLIGATIONS

- deduction = income that CRA does not wish to tax (deductions from net income before tax)
- taxable income = net income – deductions
- credit = incentives for actions that govt wishes people to take (refunds from taxable income)
- tax liability = taxable income * tax rate – tax credits

#### Example

*During 2019, Mr. Barnett has employment income of 90,000, capital gain 10,000. The tax rate applicable to him is 15%. He has medical and charity tax credit totaling 1,000.*

Division B outlines the rules for calculating the taxable capital gains (only 50%) and employment income (100%)

Division E determines the 15% tax rate and the eligible medical and charity credits

### DIVISIONS

- A = NS
- B = rules regarding net income
- C = rules regarding deductions
- D = NS
- E = rules regarding tax rates and credits

### OBJECTIONS

- Individuals: file Notice of Objection within later of: 90 days after NOA mail date OR one year after filing due date (ie. usually Apr 30)
- Corporations: Within 90 days after NOA mail date
- T2200 (states what out-of-pocket expenses must be paid to perform your job) filled and signed by employer

- can file NOOBJ online, through representative, by mail, or in person at a tax services office or tax center.

### TAX INSTALMENTS

- Must pay instalments if in at least one of last two prior years you had non-withheld tax *liability* (not income) over $3,000

For individuals, three ways to calculate tax instalments:

1. CY Option: For each Q, pay 1/4 of instalment
1. PY Option
1. 2nd PY Option: For Q1 and Q2, 1/4 of non-withheld tax liability from two years ago; for Q3 and Q4, 1/2 of (PY – (Q1 + Q2 payments))

Option 2 and 3 will result in the same *total* instalment payments each year.

But! Option 1 is dangerous because if you underestimate your tax liability (and as a result don't pay enough instalments), you are liable for interest. If you use Option 2 or 3, you are safe from interest and penalties even if your actual liability turns out to be higher than prior years.

For corporations, Option 3: For M1 and M2, 1/12 of liability from two years ago; for M3–M12, 1/10 of (PY – (M1 + M2 payments))

(Interest and penalty calculations don't need to be memorized)

#### Chapter 14 Assignment Problem 6

1. $3,750
1. Option 2: 5,753
1. 4,502 for M1 and M2; $6,003.20 for M3–M12

### INTEREST RATES

- Late payment of taxes (you owe CRA): 6%
- If CRA owes you (overpayment) as a corporation: 2%
- If CRA owes you (overpayment) as a non-corporate (individual) taxpayer: 4%

### CIVIL PENALTIES FOR MISREPRESENTATION

#### Chapter 14 Assignment Problem 8

No correct answer

- on one hand, as an accounting professional he is reasonably expected to realize the amount of income reported is too low. he seems to be indifferent (since he asked no further questions) of whether or not the neighbour is defying the law. he could be found guilty of gross negligence
- on the other hand, he relied in good faith on information provided by his neighbour (that the neighbour had no other income), and he did not exhibit culpable (ie. intentional) conduct.
