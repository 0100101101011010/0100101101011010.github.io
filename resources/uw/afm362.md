# AFM 362

** Exam mostly focuses on calculations and deadlines

## L1 & 2: RIGHTS & OBLIGATIONS (Chapters 1 & 14)

- deduction = income that CRA does not wish to tax (deductions from net income before tax)
- taxable income = net income – deductions
- credit = incentives for actions that govt wishes people to take (refunds from taxable income)
- tax liability = (net income – deductions) * tax rate – tax credits

### DIVISIONS

- A = NS
- B = rules regarding net income
  - sub division A = employment income
  - deductions:
      - sec 8 = deductions allowed against employment income (RPP contributions, RRSP contributions)
      - generally, any expense made by you the employee is *not* allowed except specific items, such as:
        - union dues
        - office rent or home office expenses
        - supplies
      - employer withholdings are *not deductible* but rather treated as *credits* (part of Div E)
- C = rules regarding deductions
- D = NS
- E = rules regarding tax rates and credits

#### Example

*During 2019, Mr. Barnett has employment income of 90,000, capital gain 10,000. The tax rate applicable to him is 15%. He has medical and charity tax credit totaling 1,000.*

Division B outlines the rules for calculating the taxable capital gains (only 50%) and employment income (100%)

Division E determines the 15% tax rate and the eligible medical and charity credits

### FILING DEADLINES

- corporations: 6 months after corporation's year end
- individuals: apr 30 unless you or spouse has self-employment income, in which case jun 15

### REQUIRED TO FILE IF...

- you are a corporation that carries on business in canada, or are resident of canada
- you are an individual who
  - owes tax for the year
  - disposed of capital property
  - are a non-resident with a taxable capital gain
  - has a positive balance in HBP or LLP
  - is demanded to file a return by the Minister
- but even if not required, you *should* file if you
  - are entitled to refund
  - are low-income and entitled to receive benefits like GST/HST credit, CCB, GIS

### EFILING (NETFILE) VS PAPER FILING

- can paper file if:
  - you are an individual
  - corporation with annual gross revenue of less than $1 million
- must efile if:
  - you are corporation with more than $1 million gross revenue in the year ($1,000 penalty for non-compliance)

benefits of efiling (netfile for individuals):

- less chance of data input errors
- tax refund can be processed faster
- taxpayer doesn't have to submit receipts and supporting documentation with the return (but CRA may request these documents any time)

### DO TAX RETURNS HAVE TO BE IN CAD$?

nope, if you're a corporation who carries on business in a foreign currency, you can report your tax results in that foreign currency as long as it's:

- eur
- gbp
- aud
- usd
- or a currency prescribed by regulation

you must elect to do this though.

### OBJECTIONS

- Individuals: file Notice of Objection within later of: 90 days after NOA mail date OR one year after filing due date (ie. usually Apr 30)
- Corporations: Within 90 days after NOA mail date
- T2200 (states what out-of-pocket expenses must be paid to perform your job) filled and signed by employer

- can file NOOBJ online, through representative, by mail, or in person at a tax services office or tax center.

### TAX INSTALMENTS

why? to give CRA a more stable, consistent revenue stream throughout the year rather than all at once

- corporations must pay instalments because they have no employer (ie. no one withholds on their behalf)
- instalments for corporations must be paid each M (and must be received by CRA by the due date; postmarked doesn't count)
- if individual, most of your income is withheld and remitted by employer. however, must pay instalments if your CY non-withheld tax liability > $3,900 *and* you PY non-withheld tax liability of *one* of the past two years > $3,000
- for Quebecers, it's $1,800
- instalments for individuals must be paid by each Q:
  - Mar 15
  - Jun 15
  - Sep 15
  - Dec 15

#### Chapter 14 Page 869 Example

An individual living in a province that's not Quebec had total tax liability on income not subject to withholding:

1. $2,900 in 2017
1. $3,100 in 2018
1. $3,300 in 2019

- in 2017 his CY tax liability < $3,000; didn't have to pay instalments
- in 2018, his CY tax liability > $3,000 but it didn't reach $3,000 in either of the two previous years; didn't have to pay instalments
- in 2019, his CY tax liability > $3,000 and one of the two previous years he also had tax liability > $3,000 (ie. in 2018); he has to pay instalments in 2019.

### CALCULATING INSTALMENTS (INDIVIDUALS)

three ways to calculate tax instalments:

1. CY Option: For each Q, pay 1/4 of your estimated tax liability for the year
1. PY Option: For each Q, pay 1/4 of the tax liability from last year (aka instalment base)
1. 2nd PY Option: For Q1 and Q2, pay 1/4 of the tax liability from two years ago; for Q3 and Q4, pay 1/2 of (PY tax liability – (Q1 + Q2 payments)) (aka half of instalment base net first two payments)

Option 2 and 3 will result in the same *total* instalment payments each year.

in general, to pay the least instalments:

- if income is increasing y over y, choose option 3
- if income is decreasing y over y, choose option 1

But! Option 1 is dangerous because if you underestimate your tax liability (and as a result don't pay enough instalments), you are liable for interest. If you use Option 2 or 3, you are safe from interest and penalties even if your actual liability turns out to be higher than prior years.

#### Example

*Mrs. Davis has income not subject to withholding of 6,000 and 5,000 for 2017 and 2018, respectively. This amount is estimated to be 8,000 for 2019. What is the least instalment she has to pay on a quarterly basis?*

1. option 1 = $8,000 * 1/4 = 2,000
1. option 2 = 5,000 * 1/4 = 1,250
1. option 3 = 6,000 * 1/4 = 1,500 + (5,000 – 1,500 * 2) * 1/2 = 1,000

therefore, choose option 2 or 3 to pay the least instalments (both will give overall 5,000 in instalments)

### CALCULATING INSTALMENTS (CORPORATIONS)

since corporations typically don't have withheld income, their entire tax liability is to be paid in instalments.

like for inds, if taxes payable this year or previous year < $3,000, do not have to pay instalments.

offsetting of arrears interest:

- not the same as the contra-interest mechanism for inds
- if a corporation is reassessed to have arrears interest, can submit written application to suspend arrears interest payable for the period in which refund interest is being calculated that could offset the arrears interest.

for corporations that are not eligible small CCPCs (see below):

- must pay monthly instalments, due on last day of each month
- calculate payments one of three ways:
  - for each M, pay 1/12 of the estimated tax liablity for CY
  - for each M, pay 1/12 of the tax liability of PY (aka instalment base)
  - for M1 and M2, pay 1/12 of instalment base of 2PY; for M3–M12, pay 1/10 of (PY instalment base – (M1 + M2 payments))

for private corporations:

- can reduce each instalment payable by 1/12 of its dividend refund on the payment of dividends for the year
- otherwise, must pay

for eligible small CCPCs:

- if an eligible small CCPC, can pay quarterly instalments instead of monthly. due on last day of each quarter of the corporation's tax year.
- *eligibility criteria*:
  - taxable income does not exceed $500,000 in either CY or PY (doesn't have to be both)
  - taxable capital employed in Canada does not exceed $10 million in either CY or PY (doesn't have to be both)
  - claimed small business deduction in either CY or PY
  - perfect compliance history:
    - it had no compliance irregularities pertaining to remittance of tax or filing of returns in the 12-month period before the due date of the quarterly instalment
- eligible CCPCs can pay instalments calculated three ways (similar to inds but not quite):
  - for each Q, pay 1/4 of the estimated tax liability for CY
  - for each Q, pay 1/4 of the tax liability from last year (aka instalment base)
  - for Q1, pay 1/4 of the tax liability from two years ago; for Q1–3, pay 1/3 of (PY tax liability – Q1 payment) (aka a third of the instalment base net the first payment)

#### Chapter 14 Assignment Problem 6

1. $3,750
1. 5,753
1. 4,502 for M1 and M2; $6,003.20 for M3–M12

### INTEREST ON LATE OR DEFICIENT INSTALMENT PAYMENTS

for individuals:

- interest is calculated from the day the instalment was due (eg. 15th of the Q) until the final payment of tax is due (eg. Apr 30 for most inds)
- interest can be cancelled if it doesn't exceed $25 for the year
- instalment interest offset aka contra-interest = a credit available if you overpaid or prepaid your instalments. it's non-refundable and can only be used to pay off instalment interest accrued.

for corporations:

- interest charged on deficient instalments is the difference between the amount of instalments actually paid and the least of the three options for calculating instalments payable (ie. CY, PY, or 2PY methods)
- interest begins to compound daily from the day the instalment was due → the earlier of date of payment or date when the remainder of tax payable is to be paid

see [PENALTIES](#penalties) for the "penalty for late or deficient instalments". applies if *any* instalments for the year are late or deficient.

** Interest and penalty calculations don't need to be memorized

### INTEREST RATES

- Late payment of taxes (you owe CRA) or late payment of tax withholdings (your employer owes CRA on your behalf) aka *arrears interest*: 6%
- If CRA owes you (overpayment) as a corporation: 2%
- If CRA owes you (overpayment) as a non-corporate (individual) taxpayer: 4%

Arrears interest is not deductible, but CRA refunds *are considered taxable income* (unless they occur in the same year as arrears interest, then they are known as "contra-interest" and can cancel out the arrears interest payable)

Refund interest is accrued from the latest of:

1. the day the overpayment arose
1. for individuals: 30 days after the balance-due date (Apr 30)
1. for corps: 120 days after end of taxation year
1. if return was filed after the filing due date:
  - for individuals: 30 days after the return was filed
  - for corps: the day the return was filed

No refund interest is payable for refunds arising from loss carryback, etc.

Remember refund interest is taxable income!

### PENALTIES

- failure to file return as required
  - 5% of the unpaid tax liability as of return deadline + 1% of the unpaid tax for each *full* month the return is late, up to 12 months
  - if you were assessed for this same penalty in any of the three PYs, your penalty is higher: 10% of unpaid tax as of return deadline + 2% per month, up to 20 months
  - also, if you fail to file the return *as required* (ie. completely and correctly), you may also be liable for this penalty in addition to the "failure to provide information on form" penalty (although if CRA agrees with the amount of taxes, there would be no penalty based on the calculation above)
- failure to report
  - lesser of 10% of the income that was not reported or 50% of the understated unpaid tax
  - applies if you failed to report an amount of income, and you have also previously failed to report in the three PYs (basically a 2-strike rule)
  - only applies if any of the CY or PY unreported amounts ≥ $500
  - penalty will not be applied if you are also charged penalty for false statements or omission (*if* this is your first failure to report. if it happens again within three years, CRA can choose between applying the failure to report penalty or the false statement penalty)
- false statements or omission
  - greater of $100 or 50% of the difference in tax liability (between falsely reported liability and actual liability)
  - applied when taxpayer *knowingly* or *gross negligently* under-reports income
  - basically, if the taxpayer knew or should've known that an amount was omitted, this penalty applies (including careless omissions)
- late or deficient instalments
  - (greater of $1,000 or 25% of the interest calculated as if no instalments had been paid) – 50% of the interest charged on late or deficient instalments
- failure to provide information on form
  - $100 for each failure
  - unless a reasonable effort was made to obtain the information that was missing (in respect to another person)

### CIVIL PENALTIES FOR MISREPRESENTATION

two types of penalties:

- planner's penalty
  - when a third party is involved in (or is reasonably expected to know of) making a false statement or omission to another person, which that person then uses for tax purposes
  - consists of either of two amounts:
    1. if the false statement is made in the course of a planning activity or valuation activity: greater of $1,000 and the total of the third party's "gross entitlement" in respect of the planning/valuation activity
    1. if the false statement is made outside the definition of a planning/valuation activity (ie. there is no gross entitlement penalty): $1,000
- preparer's penalty
  - when a third party is involved in (or is reasonably expected to know of) making a false statement or omission to/by/on behalf of another person
  - consists of greater of two amounts:
    1. $1,000
    1. 50% of the amount of tax sought to be avoided or refund sought to be obtained
  - note that this penalty has an upper limit of $100,000 + preparer's fee

![third party misrepresentation penalty](/resources/uw/images/thirdpartypenalty.jpg){:width="100%"}

further note that if the third party did not exhibit *culpable conduct*, there will likely be no penalty

### CRIMINAL OFFENCES

tax evasion:

- failure to file a return as and when required can result in a fine of $1,000–$25,000 *in addition to* possible imprisonment for up to 12 months
- on the bright side, having been convicted of this, you are not liable to pay any [penalties](#penalties) related to this :-D unless the penalty was assessed before you were charged

if you do *ALL* of the following, you may face fine of 50%–200% of tax sought to be evaded *in addition to* possible imprisonment for up to 2 years:

1. making false statement in a return
1. destroying books and records
1. falsifying books and records
1. wilfully attempting avoid tax compliance
1. conspiring to commit any of the above offences

### ASSESSMENTS AND REASSESSMENTS

normal reassessment period (starting from mailing of NOA):

- individuals = within 3 years
- CCPCs = within 3 years
- non-CCPC corps = within 4 years

however, if the taxpayer or preparer of the return has made any misrepresentation attributable to neglect, carelessness, or fraud, CRA can reassess *at any time*

the taxpayer themself can extend reassessment period by filing a "waiver of statutory assessment period":

- why? to solve some complicated unresolved current issues with CRA
- the ability to reassess granted by this waiver *only* covers the issues specified in the waiver (CRA does not have full reassessment power over the entire return)
- taxpayer can revoke the notice with 6 months' notice

if the taxpayer is requesting a reassessment to allow carryback to an earlier year, CRA can reassess an expired return as long as it is within three years of expiration of the normal reassessment period

in some cases, if the taxpayer makes an application to the Minister to reduce taxes, interest, or penalties for a prior year, the Minister can reassess any return in a 10-year period.

### OBJECTIONS TO NOTICE OF ASSESSMENT

deadline to file objection:

- individual: later of 90 days after NOA mail date or 1 year after filing due date
- corporation: 90 days after NOA mail date

### AMENDED RETURNS

for carryback of losses:

- individuals must file T1A
- corporations must file T2A
- OR file an amended return by the filing deadline of the year the loss was incurred

for amending most other items:

- file NOOBJ if within 90-day period
- make a written request for a refund within three years of the end of the year in question

### EMPLOYER WITHHOLDINGS AND PAYMENTS TO RESIDENTS

- employers, payers of interest / dividends / royalties / etc and RRSP trustees are required to file *information returns*
- deadline: last day of Feb

remittances to CRA:

- very large employers (any month's remittances exceeds $100,000):
  - must remit up to four times a month
- large employers (monthly remittances average $25,000–$100,000):
  - tax withheld in the first 15 days of the month is due on the 25th of that month; tax withheld in the remaining days are paid on the 10th of the next month
  - if remittances in any month exceed $100,000 follow rule for "very large employers" above
- mid-sized employers (monthly remittances average less than $25,000):
  - remit on the 15th of the next month
- small employers (monthly remittances average less than $3,000):
  - allowed to remit quarterly (Apr 15, Jul 15, Oct 15, next year's Jan 15)
  - IF there are no compliance regularities by the company in the past 12 months

employees fill out a TD1 form, which employer will follow to determine the amount to withhold (employees can elect to withhold more by not declaring certain credits etc on the form)

if withholding would cause "undue hardship," employee can apply to the CRA district office to reduce the amount withheld if a *pro forma* return shows that a large refund is expected for the year (due to RRSP contributions, support payments, etc.)

bonuses are subject to withholdings (these rates don't apply to Quebec):

- 10% for bonuses under $5,000
- 20% for bonuses $5,000–$15,000
- 30% for bonuses over $15,000
- stock option benefits are considered to be bonuses therefore are subject to these withholding rules.

failure of the employer to withhold results in a penalty = 10% of the tax that should've been withheld + interest on that amount. if this is a repeat offence, the penalty = 20%

### PAYMENTS TO NON-RESIDENTS

- typically canadian payers are required to withhold 25% (15% if it's a fee or commission) of the amount to non-residents, but often this is reduced or eliminated by a tax treaty
- often must file NR4

Part XIII and NR6 (for non-residents receiving rental income or timber royalties in canada):

- default: under Part XIII, pay a flat withholding tax on the *gross income* received from rent/royalties
- OR, can elect to file an income tax return, using the *net income* (but withholdings are still done on the basis of gross income, so you'll essentially receive a refund at the end of the year on excess Part XIII tax withheld)
  - must file return within 2 years of the end of the year that rent/royalties were paid
- OR, can further file NR6 in addition to the general election above (must be filed before the NR receives the first rent/royalties payment) in which an agent of the NR can withhold tax on the basis of *net* (rather than gross) income
  - must file return within 6 months of the end of the year that rent/royalties were paid

#### Example

*Kevin filed his 2018 tax return to the CRA on March 26th, 2019. Notice of assessment was mailed to him on April 12th. When is the latest he can file an objection?*

later of: apr 30 2020 or jul 11 2019 (so he has up to jul 11 to appeal CRA’s NOA)

#### Chapter 14 Assignment Problem 8

No correct answer

- on one hand, as an accounting professional he is reasonably expected to realize the amount of income reported is too low. he seems to be indifferent (since he asked no further questions) of whether or not the neighbour is defying the law. he could be found guilty of gross negligence
- on the other hand, he relied in good faith on information provided by his neighbour (that the neighbour had no other income), and he did not exhibit culpable (ie. intentional) conduct.

## L3 & 4: Employment Income (Chapter 3)

- all employed individuals have a Dec 31 year-end
- self-employed individuals essentially have the same: if they want a different year end, they must use a more complicated way of reporting business income (boooo).
  - attempting to circumvent this by incorporating the business will form a PSB ("personal services business")
  - there are special rules governing PSBs that eliminate the advantages of incorporating at all because the govt knows what you're tryna pull

### Division B Subdivision A: Employment Income Inclusions and Deductions

note that employment income is calculated on cash basis, not accrual like for corporate income; you are taxed on what you have received in the year, not what you have earned. EXCEPT: when an employee voluntarily defers a remuneration that they had an unconditional right to receive, it will be counted in the year it was earned because that was when it became *receivable*, even if they chose not to *receive* it.

income inclusions:

- salary, wages, gratuities, honoraria, bonuses, commission, director's fees
- sec. 6 = other income inclusions arising from employment (benefits, company-provided car, EI benefits, reimbursement for food and board, life insurance premium paid by employer, etc.)
- sec. 7 = stock option benefits
- basically, any amount received directly or indirectly as a *result of employment*, is part of your remuneration

allowance and reimbursement are the same technically, just timing is different, but both are eventually paid by the employer on employee's behalf, thus can potentially be part of your employment income. see two-stage test:

- is the payment an allowance or reimbursement?
  - if allowance → is the allowance only for travelling expense, is it reasonable?
    - yes → is the employee a salesperson or negotiating person for the company?
      - yes = not a taxable benefit
      - no → does the ordinary (non sales/negotiating) employee have to travel away from the municipality and metropolitan area in which the employee ordinarily works?
        - yes = not a taxable benefit
        - no = typically will be treated as a taxable benefit
    - no = typically will be treated as a taxable benefit
  - if reimbursement → did employee receive an economic benefit?
    - no = not a taxable benefit to the employee
    - yes = will be included in employment income

motor vehicle allowances for ordinary (non-sales/negotiating) employees (if used only for expenses relating to travelling in the performance of employment duties) will be considered reasonable (non-taxable) if the allowance is less than 58¢ for the first 5,000 km and 52¢ for the remaining km

exceptions to income inclusion:

- employer contributions to:
  - RPP or PRPP
  - group sickness or accident insurance plan
  - private health insurance plan or provincial health tax levies (treated as human basic right; you should therefore not be taxed on it)
    - note that contributions to provincial health plan premiums *are* included in income
  - supplementary unemployment benefit plan (public or private)
  - deferred profit sharing plan
  - group term life insurance policy
- benefits under a retirement compensation arrangement, employee benefit plan, or employee trust, because they are already included in income under another provision
- benefits relating to automobile use, again because they are already included in income under another provision
- counselling benefits (mental or physical) relating to reemployment or retirement of the employee
- benefits under a salary deferral arrangement already included in income
- education assistance provided by employer IF it's an arm's length dealing and the education assistance isn't a substitute for existing salary, wages, or other remuneration
- food and board allowance, if:
  - employee is working at a special work site so far away that they cannot be reasonably expected to travel daily
  - the temporary nature or remoteness of the work site is such that it is not reasonable to establish a domestic establishment as a principal place of residence
  - the board and lodging is necessary for more than 36 hours

other "fringe benefits" that the CRA doesn't bother to tax:

- employee membership to a social club paid by the employer, if the membership primarily is for the benefit of the employer
- loyalty program points earned while travelling on employer-paid trips, if the points cannot be converted to cash and is not meant to be a substitute for remuneration
- business trips where the spouse travels with the employee, if the spouse is also primarily engaged in business activities on the employer's behalf
- non-cash gifts, if total value is less than $500
- immaterial or nominal amounts (aka company merch)
- overtime meals and allowances, if it's two hours of overtime or more and value of the meal ≤ $17
- moving allowances, for the first $650 incurred, if the move was employment-related

if your employer compensates you for incurring a capital loss on the disposition of your residence, the first $15,000 is tax-free. any reimbursement in excess of that, half is taxable and included in your employment income.

volunteer emergency workers can receive up to $1,000 in allowances, tax-free.

#### Example

All of the following are remuneration:

- payment of a hockey player's agent fee by a hockey club
- tax equalization payment made to an employee to compensate for the higher canadian taxes
- trip incentive paid to a sales person by the employer's supplier

#### Example

*An employee is paid a monthly flat-rate allowance for travel inside their regular employment area. They are also paid a reasonable per-km rate for travel outside the employment area. Has the employee incurred any taxable benefits from receiving these allowances?*

The flat-rate allowance is taxable but the per-km allowance is not.

### RPP ()

- employee's contribution is *deductible*
- employer's matched amount is *taxable*; cannot be deducted from income

deduction is limited to 18% of employee's earnings

RRSP (employer has nothing to do with this; only employee will ever contribute to RRSP; even if unemployed, you can still add to RRSP of your own free will)

#### Example

correct answer: $122,000

- if you benefit most from the expense, it is likely *not deductible* (eg. company-paid vacation); if you do not really personally benefit but rather it is necessary for work, it is likely *deductible* (eg. salesperson's car expenses)
-

#### Example

- *Professional due paid by the employee to CPA Canada.* Can be deducted because the expense is work-related.
- *Gym membership paid by the employer.* Included in income because the expense largely benefits employee rather than for work purposes.
- *Business trip paid by the employer.* Can be deducted because the expense is work-related.
- *Home internet paid by the employee.* Unless for home office, the expense benefits the employee, is not related to work, therefore cannot be deducted.

### STOCK OPTIONS

= the right to purchase shares at a given price (lower than market price)

- exercise price = price that you are able to purchase shares at (which is lower than market price)
- FMV at exercise = market price of shares when shares are exercised
- price of disposition = price that you eventually sell the shares at

the discount of your purchase is part of your employment income.

employees who receive stock options will eventually receive both employment income and capital gains

- FMV at exercise – exercise price = included in your employment income
- FMV at disposition – FMV at exercise = capital gains; not relevant to employment income

three dates of importance:

1. grant date = day on which the option is granted to the employee. no tax implications.
1. exercise date = day on which employee purchases the shares at a discount (exercising their option). possible tax implications depending on your employer:
  - if working for public corporation: must include the discount in the employment income of the year that the shares are exercised. EMPLOYMENT INCOME has been received.
  - if working for CCPC, has a benefit: can defer recognition of the discount *until disposition of shares*
1. selling date = day on which employee disposes of the shares (by selling them). a CAPITAL GAIN (LOSS) has been realized.
  - for CCPC employee, this is also when their employment income is recognized.

### DIVISION C DEDUCTION FOR STOCK OPTIONS

1/2 of employment income from stock options can be deducted if:

- from public corp: cannot be in-the-money
- from CCPC: either cannot be in-the-money, or must hold for at least two years before exercising (doesn't have to meet both criteria)

- in-the-money: exercise price is already lower than FMV *on the day the options are granted* (not exercise date)
  - ie. if you exercise them right away on the same day as they are granted, you're guaranteed to make money
- out-of-money: on the grant date, the exercise price is higher than FMV
- at-the-money: exercise price = exercise price *is the same as* FMV on the grant date
  - this is the *most common type of stock option* (eg. a company grants stock options at the market price today, the assumption is you will hold onto them for a while as they gain value, then when you exercise them, you will be able to buy at a discount)

note that, the only benefit received by CCPC employees is a matter of *timing*, not amount: the amount of income inclusion is the same for both groups of employees.

#### Example: *5 options to purchase 20 shares each at $12. FMV at grant date is $10. Exercise when FMV is $15. Sell when FMV is $19.*

this is an out-of-money stock option grant.

note that we used the FMV-at-exercise to calculate capital gains, rather than the exercise price of $12. otherwise part of the employment income would've been taxed twice.

*Tax implications for a public corporation?*

Div C

*For a CCPC?*

### AUTOMOBILE BENEFITS

typically, an employer-provided vehicle will be used for both personal and business use. CRA seeks to tax the benefit arising from the personal use portion.

definition of automobile *excludes*:
  - rail or trolley cars
  - emergency vehicles (police, fire, ambulance)
  - taxis, hearses, and vehicle inventory.
  - but if you do drive one of these excepted vehicles, you still have a taxable benefit (there is no strict calculation; any reasonable approach to determining the value of the benefit is acceptable)

- standby charge = benefit received from having a company-owned or -leased capital asset available for use
  - A/B × (2% × (C×D) + 2/3 × (E–F))
  - if owned, use: A/B × 2% × C×D
  - if leasing, use: A/B × 2/3 × (E–F)
  - A/B
    - A = lesser of B or the total personal-use km driven during the period when the car was available
    - B = 1,667 km × (total days car was available / 30, rounding to closest month) (will be 20,004 km if available for whole year)
    - when personal use <50%, A/B has to be manually calculated. when personal use >50%, A/B automatically becomes 1.
    - the larger A/B is, the more taxable benefits you will be considered to have received (ie. the more you will be taxed)
  - 2% = CRA says for each month you use the vehicle, you consume ~2% of its value (therefore you must be taxed on the 2%)
  - C×D (applies if company-*owned*)
    - C = full original cost (including HST) of employer-owned automobile
    - D = total days car was available / 30 (will be 12 if available for whole year)
  - E–F (applies if company-*leased*)
    - E = lease payments (including HST) made by employer
    - F = portion of the lease payments that relates to insurance
- operating benefit = benefit received as a result of the employer paying for the vehicle's operating expenses on employee's behalf
  - operating expenses include gas, insurance, maintenance, but not parking
  - prescribed by CRA to be: for each km driven, 28¢ of benefits paid by employer to you
  - if personal use is more than 50%, use above formula ($0.28 * personal-use km driven)
  - if personal use is less than 50%, can use the same formula above OR 1/2 of standby charge (if you wanna use this method, must inform your employer in writing before end of the tax year)

** exam questions will not deal with partial-year automobile benefit calculations (so you can always use B = 20,0004 and D = 12)

the worst is if you drive a car for like 10 km and 8 of those are personal use, then you'll end up paying a lot of tax for barely any personal benefit.

also, you'll be taxed a lot more if you use it slightly more for personal use than business use, so try to use at least slightly more than 50% for business.

if you have to reimburse employer for using the vehicle, these reimbursements count as deductions to the automobile income inclusion, but you must do it within 45 days of the end of the tax year.

what if *you the employee* own the vehicle, but your employer reimburses you for operating costs?

- pro-rate the total costs paid by employer by (personal use / total use) ratio = amount to be included in employment income as an automobile benefit
- you will have to keep detailed logs of your personal-use and business-use km driven

### RPP DEFINED BENEFIT VS DEFINED CONTRIBUTION

defined benefit (benefit to you the employee is the same regardless of plan performance)

- big risk for employer because if plan investment does poorly in the market, they must still pay you the same amount
- employer may lose money if investment is bad

defined contribution aka money-purchase (more commonly used, it's less expensive for the employer):

- risk is taken on by employee—market decides how much your RPP earns, employer doesn't have to make it up to you if the investment is bad
- if plan performs poorly, the employee is paid less
