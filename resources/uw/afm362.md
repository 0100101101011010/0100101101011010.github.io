# AFM 362

** Exam mostly focuses on calculations and deadlines

## L1 & 2: RIGHTS & OBLIGATIONS (Chapters 1 & 14)

- deduction = income that CRA does not wish to tax (deductions from net income before tax)
- taxable income = net income – deductions
- credit = incentives for actions that govt wishes people to take (refunds from taxable income)
- tax liability = (net income – deductions) * tax rate – tax credits

### DIVISIONS

- A = NS
- B = rules regarding net income
  - sub division A = employment income
  - deductions:
      - sec 8 = deductions allowed against employment income (RPP contributions, RRSP contributions)
      - generally, any expense made by you the employee is *not* allowed except specific items, such as:
        - union dues
        - office rent or home office expenses
        - supplies
      - employer withholdings are *not deductible* but rather treated as *credits* (part of Div E)
- C = rules regarding deductions
- D = NS
- E = rules regarding tax rates and credits

#### Example

*During 2019, Mr. Barnett has employment income of 90,000, capital gain 10,000. The tax rate applicable to him is 15%. He has medical and charity tax credit totaling 1,000.*

Division B outlines the rules for calculating the taxable capital gains (only 50%) and employment income (100%)

Division E determines the 15% tax rate and the eligible medical and charity credits

### FILING DEADLINES

- corporations: 6 months after corporation's year end
- individuals: apr 30 unless you or spouse has self-employment income, in which case jun 15

### REQUIRED TO FILE IF...

- you are a corporation that carries on business in canada, or are resident of canada
- you are an individual who
  - owes tax for the year
  - disposed of capital property
  - are a non-resident with a taxable capital gain
  - has a positive balance in HBP or LLP
  - is demanded to file a return by the Minister
- but even if not required, you *should* file if you
  - are entitled to refund
  - are low-income and entitled to receive benefits like GST/HST credit, CCB, GIS

### EFILING (NETFILE) VS PAPER FILING

- can paper file if:
  - you are an individual
  - corporation with annual gross revenue of less than $1 million
- must efile if:
  - you are corporation with more than $1 million gross revenue in the year ($1,000 penalty for non-compliance)

benefits of efiling (netfile for individuals):

- less chance of data input errors
- tax refund can be processed faster
- taxpayer doesn't have to submit receipts and supporting documentation with the return (but CRA may request these documents any time)

### DO TAX RETURNS HAVE TO BE IN CAD$?

nope, if you're a corporation who carries on business in a foreign currency, you can report your tax results in that foreign currency as long as it's:

- eur
- gbp
- aud
- usd
- or a currency prescribed by regulation

you must elect to do this though.

### OBJECTIONS

- Individuals: file Notice of Objection within later of: 90 days after NOA mail date OR one year after filing due date (ie. usually Apr 30)
- Corporations: Within 90 days after NOA mail date
- T2200 (states what out-of-pocket expenses must be paid to perform your job) filled and signed by employer

- can file NOOBJ online, through representative, by mail, or in person at a tax services office or tax center.

### TAX INSTALMENTS

why? to give CRA a more stable, consistent revenue stream throughout the year rather than all at once

- corporations must pay instalments because they have no employer (ie. no one withholds on their behalf)
- instalments for corporations must be paid each M (and must be received by CRA by the due date; postmarked doesn't count)
- if individual, most of your income is withheld and remitted by employer. however, must pay instalments if your CY non-withheld tax liability > $3,000 *and* your PY non-withheld tax liability of *one* of the past two years > $3,000
- for Quebecers, it's $1,800
- instalments for individuals must be paid by each Q:
  - Mar 15
  - Jun 15
  - Sep 15
  - Dec 15

#### Chapter 14 Page 869 Example

An individual living in a province that's not Quebec had total tax liability on income not subject to withholding:

1. $2,900 in 2017
1. $3,100 in 2018
1. $3,300 in 2019

- in 2017 his CY tax liability < $3,000; didn't have to pay instalments
- in 2018, his CY tax liability > $3,000 but it didn't reach $3,000 in either of the two previous years; didn't have to pay instalments
- in 2019, his CY tax liability > $3,000 and one of the two previous years he also had tax liability > $3,000 (ie. in 2018); he has to pay instalments in 2019.

### CALCULATING INSTALMENTS (INDIVIDUALS)

three ways to calculate tax instalments:

1. CY Option: For each Q, pay 1/4 of your estimated tax liability for the year
1. PY Option: For each Q, pay 1/4 of the tax liability from last year (aka instalment base)
1. 2nd PY Option: For Q1 and Q2, pay 1/4 of the tax liability from two years ago; for Q3 and Q4, pay 1/2 of (PY tax liability – (Q1 + Q2 payments)) (aka half of instalment base net first two payments)

Option 2 and 3 will result in the same *total* instalment payments each year.

in general, to pay the least instalments:

- if income is increasing y over y, choose option 3
- if income is decreasing y over y, choose option 1

But! Option 1 is dangerous because if you underestimate your tax liability (and as a result don't pay enough instalments), you are liable for interest. If you use Option 2 or 3, you are safe from interest and penalties even if your actual liability turns out to be higher than prior years.

#### Example

*Mrs. Davis has income not subject to withholding of 6,000 and 5,000 for 2017 and 2018, respectively. This amount is estimated to be 8,000 for 2019. What is the least instalment she has to pay on a quarterly basis?*

1. option 1 = $8,000 * 1/4 = 2,000
1. option 2 = 5,000 * 1/4 = 1,250
1. option 3 = 6,000 * 1/4 = 1,500 for Q1 and Q2; (5,000 – 1,500 * 2) / 2 = 1,000 for Q3 and Q4

therefore, choose option 2 or 3 to pay the least instalments (both will give overall 5,000 in instalments)

### CALCULATING INSTALMENTS (CORPORATIONS)

since corporations typically don't have withheld income, their entire tax liability is to be paid in instalments.

like for inds, if taxes payable this year or previous year < $3,000, do not have to pay instalments.

offsetting of arrears interest:

- not the same as the contra-interest mechanism for inds
- if a corporation is reassessed to have arrears interest, can submit written application to suspend arrears interest payable for the period in which refund interest is being calculated that could offset the arrears interest.

for corporations that are not eligible small CCPCs (see below):

- must pay monthly instalments, due on last day of each month
- calculate payments one of three ways:
  - for each M, pay 1/12 of the estimated tax liability for CY
  - for each M, pay 1/12 of the tax liability of PY (aka instalment base)
  - for M1 and M2, pay 1/12 of instalment base of 2PY; for M3–M12, pay 1/10 of (PY instalment base – (M1 + M2 payments))

for private corporations:

- can reduce each instalment payable by 1/12 of its dividend refund on the payment of dividends for the year
- otherwise, must pay full amount as calculated in one the ways above

for eligible small CCPCs:

- if an eligible small CCPC, can pay quarterly instalments instead of monthly. due on last day of each quarter of the corporation's tax year.
- *eligibility criteria*:
  - taxable income does not exceed $500,000 in either CY or PY (doesn't have to be both)
  - taxable capital employed in Canada does not exceed $10 million in either CY or PY (doesn't have to be both)
  - claimed small business deduction in either CY or PY
  - perfect compliance history:
    - it had no compliance irregularities pertaining to remittance of tax or filing of returns in the 12-month period before the due date of the quarterly instalment
- eligible CCPCs can pay instalments calculated three ways (similar to inds but not quite):
  - for each Q, pay 1/4 of the estimated tax liability for CY
  - for each Q, pay 1/4 of the tax liability from last year (aka instalment base)
  - for Q1, pay 1/4 of the tax liability from two years ago; for Q2–4, pay 1/3 of (PY tax liability – Q1 payment) (aka a third of the instalment base net the first payment)

#### Chapter 14 Assignment Problem 6

1. $3,750
1. 5,753
1. 4,502 for M1 and M2; $6,003.20 for M3–M12

### INTEREST ON LATE OR DEFICIENT INSTALMENT PAYMENTS

for individuals:

- interest is calculated from the day the instalment was due (eg. 15th of the Q) until the final payment of tax is due (eg. Apr 30 for most inds)
- interest can be cancelled if it doesn't exceed $25 for the year
- instalment interest offset aka contra-interest = a credit available if you overpaid or prepaid your instalments. it's non-refundable and can only be used to pay off instalment interest accrued.

for corporations:

- interest charged on deficient instalments is the difference between the amount of instalments actually paid and the least of the three options for calculating instalments payable (ie. CY, PY, or 2PY methods)
- interest begins to compound daily from the day the instalment was due → the earlier of date of payment or date when the remainder of tax payable is to be paid

see [PENALTIES](#penalties) for the "penalty for late or deficient instalments". applies if *any* instalments for the year are late or deficient.

** Interest and penalty calculations don't need to be memorized

### INTEREST RATES

- Late payment of taxes (you owe CRA) or late payment of tax withholdings (your employer owes CRA on your behalf) aka *arrears interest*: 6%
- If CRA owes you (overpayment) as a corporation: 2%
- If CRA owes you (overpayment) as a non-corporate (individual) taxpayer: 4%

Arrears interest is not deductible, but CRA refunds *are considered taxable income* (unless they occur in the same year as arrears interest, then they are known as "contra-interest" and can cancel out the arrears interest payable)

Refund interest is accrued from the latest of:

1. the day the overpayment arose
1. for individuals: 30 days after the balance-due date (Apr 30)
1. for corps: 120 days after end of taxation year
1. if return was filed after the filing due date:
  - for individuals: 30 days after the return was filed
  - for corps: the day the return was filed

No refund interest is payable for refunds arising from loss carryback, etc.

Remember refund interest is taxable income!

### PENALTIES

- failure to file return as required
  - 5% of the unpaid tax liability as of return deadline + 1% of the unpaid tax for each *full* month the return is late, up to 12 months
  - if you were assessed for this same penalty in any of the three PYs, your penalty is higher: 10% of unpaid tax as of return deadline + 2% per month, up to 20 months
  - also, if you fail to file the return *as required* (ie. completely and correctly), you may also be liable for this penalty in addition to the "failure to provide information on form" penalty (although if CRA agrees with the amount of taxes, there would be no penalty based on the calculation above)
- failure to report
  - lesser of 10% of the income that was not reported or 50% of the understated unpaid tax
  - applies if you failed to report an amount of income, and you have also previously failed to report in the three PYs (basically a 2-strike rule)
  - only applies if any of the CY or PY unreported amounts ≥ $500
  - penalty will not be applied if you are also charged penalty for false statements or omission (*if* this is your first failure to report. if it happens again within three years, CRA can choose between applying the failure to report penalty or the false statement penalty)
- false statements or omission
  - greater of $100 or 50% of the difference in tax liability (between falsely reported liability and actual liability)
  - applied when taxpayer *knowingly* or *gross negligently* under-reports income
  - basically, if the taxpayer knew or should've known that an amount was omitted, this penalty applies (including careless omissions)
- late or deficient instalments
  - (greater of $1,000 or 25% of the interest calculated as if no instalments had been paid) – 50% of the interest charged on late or deficient instalments
- failure to provide information on form
  - $100 for each failure
  - unless a reasonable effort was made to obtain the information that was missing (in respect to another person)

### CIVIL PENALTIES FOR MISREPRESENTATION

two types of penalties:

- planner's penalty
  - when a third party is involved in (or is reasonably expected to know of) making a false statement or omission to another person, which that person then uses for tax purposes
  - consists of either of two amounts:
    1. if the false statement is made in the course of a planning activity or valuation activity: greater of $1,000 and the total of the third party's "gross entitlement" in respect of the planning/valuation activity
    1. if the false statement is made outside the definition of a planning/valuation activity (ie. there is no gross entitlement penalty): $1,000
- preparer's penalty
  - when a third party is involved in (or is reasonably expected to know of) making a false statement or omission to/by/on behalf of another person
  - consists of greater of two amounts:
    1. $1,000
    1. 50% of the amount of tax sought to be avoided or refund sought to be obtained
  - note that this penalty has an upper limit of $100,000 + preparer's fee

![third party misrepresentation penalty](/resources/uw/images/thirdpartypenalty.jpg){:width="50%"}

further note that if the third party did not exhibit *culpable conduct*, there will likely be no penalty

### CRIMINAL OFFENCES

tax evasion:

- failure to file a return as and when required can result in a fine of $1,000–$25,000 *in addition to* possible imprisonment for up to 12 months
- on the bright side, having been convicted of this, you are not liable to pay any [penalties](#penalties) related to this :-D unless the penalty was assessed before you were charged

if you do *ALL* of the following, you may face fine of 50%–200% of tax sought to be evaded *in addition to* possible imprisonment for up to 2 years:

1. making false statement in a return
1. destroying books and records
1. falsifying books and records
1. wilfully attempting avoid tax compliance
1. conspiring to commit any of the above offences

### ASSESSMENTS AND REASSESSMENTS

normal reassessment period (starting from mailing of NOA):

- individuals = within 3 years
- CCPCs = within 3 years
- non-CCPC corps = within 4 years

however, if the taxpayer or preparer of the return has made any misrepresentation attributable to neglect, carelessness, or fraud, CRA can reassess *at any time*

the taxpayer themself can extend reassessment period by filing a "waiver of statutory assessment period":

- why? to solve some complicated unresolved current issues with CRA
- the ability to reassess granted by this waiver *only* covers the issues specified in the waiver (CRA does not have full reassessment power over the entire return)
- taxpayer can revoke the notice with 6 months' notice

if the taxpayer is requesting a reassessment to allow carryback to an earlier year, CRA can reassess an expired return as long as it is within three years of expiration of the normal reassessment period

in some cases, if the taxpayer makes an application to the Minister to reduce taxes, interest, or penalties for a prior year, the Minister can reassess any return in a 10-year period.

### OBJECTIONS TO NOTICE OF ASSESSMENT

deadline to file objection:

- individual: later of 90 days after NOA mail date or 1 year after filing due date
- corporation: 90 days after NOA mail date

### AMENDED RETURNS

for carryback of losses:

- individuals must file T1A
- corporations must file T2A
- OR file an amended return by the filing deadline of the year the loss was incurred

for amending most other items:

- file NOOBJ if within 90-day period
- make a written request for a refund within three years of the end of the year in question

### EMPLOYER WITHHOLDINGS AND PAYMENTS TO RESIDENTS

- employers, payers of interest / dividends / royalties / etc and RRSP trustees are required to file *information returns*
- deadline: last day of Feb

remittances to CRA:

- very large employers (any month's remittances exceeds $100,000):
  - must remit up to four times a month
- large employers (monthly remittances average $25,000–$100,000):
  - tax withheld in the first 15 days of the month is due on the 25th of that month; tax withheld in the remaining days are paid on the 10th of the next month
  - if remittances in any month exceed $100,000 follow rule for "very large employers" above
- mid-sized employers (monthly remittances average less than $25,000):
  - remit on the 15th of the next month
- small employers (monthly remittances average less than $3,000):
  - allowed to remit quarterly (Apr 15, Jul 15, Oct 15, next year's Jan 15)
  - IF there are no compliance regularities by the company in the past 12 months

employees fill out a TD1 form, which employer will follow to determine the amount to withhold (employees can elect to withhold more by not declaring certain credits etc on the form)

if withholding would cause "undue hardship," employee can apply to the CRA district office to reduce the amount withheld if a *pro forma* return shows that a large refund is expected for the year (due to RRSP contributions, support payments, etc.)

bonuses are subject to withholdings (these rates don't apply to Quebec):

- 10% for bonuses under $5,000
- 20% for bonuses $5,000–$15,000
- 30% for bonuses over $15,000
- stock option benefits are considered to be bonuses therefore are subject to these withholding rules.

failure of the employer to withhold results in a penalty = 10% of the tax that should've been withheld + interest on that amount. if this is a repeat offence, the penalty = 20%

### PAYMENTS TO NON-RESIDENTS

- typically canadian payers are required to withhold 25% (15% if it's a fee or commission) of the amount to non-residents, but often this is reduced or eliminated by a tax treaty
- often must file NR4

Part XIII and NR6 (for non-residents receiving rental income or timber royalties in canada):

- default: under Part XIII, pay a flat withholding tax on the *gross income* received from rent/royalties
- OR, can elect to file an income tax return, using the *net income* (but withholdings are still done on the basis of gross income, so you'll essentially receive a refund at the end of the year on excess Part XIII tax withheld)
  - must file return within 2 years of the end of the year that rent/royalties were paid
- OR, can further file NR6 in addition to the general election above (must be filed before the NR receives the first rent/royalties payment) in which an agent of the NR can withhold tax on the basis of *net* (rather than gross) income
  - must file return within 6 months of the end of the year that rent/royalties were paid

#### Example

*Kevin filed his 2018 tax return to the CRA on March 26th, 2019. Notice of assessment was mailed to him on April 12th. When is the latest he can file an objection?*

later of: apr 30 2020 or jul 11 2019 (so he has up to jul 11 to appeal CRA’s NOA)

#### Chapter 14 Assignment Problem 8

No correct answer

- on one hand, as an accounting professional he is reasonably expected to realize the amount of income reported is too low. he seems to be indifferent (since he asked no further questions) of whether or not the neighbour is defying the law. he could be found guilty of gross negligence
- on the other hand, he relied in good faith on information provided by his neighbour (that the neighbour had no other income), and he did not exhibit culpable (ie. intentional) conduct.

## L3 & 4: Employment Income (Chapter 3)

- all employed individuals have a Dec 31 year-end
- self-employed individuals essentially have the same: if they want a different year end, they must use a more complicated way of reporting business income (boooo).
  - attempting to circumvent this by incorporating the business will form a PSB ("personal services business")
  - there are special rules governing PSBs that eliminate the advantages of incorporating at all because the govt knows what you're tryna pull

### Division B Subdivision A: Income or Loss from an Office or Employment

note that employment income is calculated on cash basis, not accrual like for corporate income; you are taxed on what you have received in the year, not what you have earned. EXCEPT: when an employee voluntarily defers a remuneration that they had an unconditional right to receive, it will be counted in the year it was earned because that was when it became *receivable*, even if they chose not to *receive* it.

income inclusions:

- salary, wages, gratuities, honoraria, bonuses, commission, director's fees
- sec. 6 = other income inclusions arising from employment (benefits, company-provided car, EI benefits, reimbursement for food and board, life insurance premium paid by employer, etc.)
- sec. 7 = stock option benefits
- basically, any amount received directly or indirectly as a *result of employment*, is part of your remuneration

allowance and reimbursement are the same technically, just timing is different, but both are eventually paid by the employer on employee's behalf, thus can potentially be part of your employment income. see two-stage test:

- is the payment an allowance or reimbursement?
  - if allowance → is the allowance only for travelling expense, is it reasonable?
    - yes → is the employee a salesperson or negotiating person for the company?
      - yes = not a taxable benefit
      - no → does the ordinary (non sales/negotiating) employee have to travel away from the municipality and metropolitan area in which the employee ordinarily works?
        - yes = not a taxable benefit
        - no = typically will be treated as a taxable benefit
    - no = typically will be treated as a taxable benefit
  - if reimbursement → did employee receive an economic benefit?
    - no = not a taxable benefit to the employee
    - yes = will be included in employment income

motor vehicle allowances for ordinary (non-sales/negotiating) employees (if used only for expenses relating to travelling in the performance of employment duties) will be considered reasonable (non-taxable) if the allowance is less than 58¢ for the first 5,000 km and 52¢ for the remaining km

exceptions to income inclusion:

- employer contributions to:
  - RPP or PRPP
  - group sickness or accident insurance plan
  - private health insurance plan or provincial health tax levies (treated as human basic right; you should therefore not be taxed on it)
    - note that contributions to provincial health plan premiums *are* included in income
    - note that if *you the employee* must contribute a certain amount as well to the plan, you cannot deduct your contribution from your employment income (can't deduct under Division B right now, may be able to deduct as a medical expense later on under Division E)
  - supplementary unemployment benefit plan (public or private)
  - deferred profit sharing plan
  - group term life insurance policy
- benefits under a retirement compensation arrangement, employee benefit plan, or employee trust, because they are already included in income under another provision
- benefits relating to automobile use, again because they are already included in income under another provision
- counselling benefits (mental or physical) relating to reemployment or retirement of the employee
- benefits under a salary deferral arrangement already included in income
- education assistance provided by employer IF it's an arm's length dealing and the education assistance isn't a substitute for existing salary, wages, or other remuneration
- food and board allowance, if:
  - employee is working at a special work site so far away that they cannot be reasonably expected to travel daily
  - the temporary nature or remoteness of the work site is such that it is not reasonable to establish a domestic establishment as a principal place of residence
  - the board and lodging is necessary for more than 36 hours

other "fringe benefits" that the CRA doesn't bother to tax:

- employee membership to a social club paid by the employer, if the membership primarily is for the benefit of the employer
- loyalty program points earned while travelling on employer-paid trips, if the points cannot be converted to cash and is not meant to be a substitute for remuneration
- business trips where the spouse travels with the employee, if the spouse is also primarily engaged in business activities on the employer's behalf
- non-cash gifts, if total value is less than $500
- immaterial or nominal amounts (aka company merch)
- overtime meals and allowances, if it's two hours of overtime or more and value of the meal ≤ $17
- moving allowances, for the first $650 incurred, if the move was employment-related and you are moving *closer* to place of employment
- employee discounts, unless the discount is so steep that the employee can purchase items *below cost* (aka company is taking a loss on those items sold)

if your employer compensates you for incurring a capital loss on the disposition of your residence, the first $15,000 is tax-free. any reimbursement in excess of that, half is taxable and included in your employment income.

volunteer emergency workers can receive up to $1,000 in allowances, tax-free.

#### Example

All of the following are remuneration:

- payment of a hockey player's agent fee by a hockey club
- tax equalization payment made to an employee to compensate for the higher canadian taxes
- trip incentive paid to a sales person by the employer's supplier

#### Example

*An employee is paid a monthly flat-rate allowance for travel inside their regular employment area. They are also paid a reasonable per-km rate for travel outside the employment area. Has the employee incurred any taxable benefits from receiving these allowances?*

The flat-rate allowance is taxable but the per-km allowance is not.

### RPP (REGISTERED PENSION PLAN) OR PRPP (POOLED REGISTERED PENSION PLAN)

- employee's contribution is *deductible* from income (ie. the more you contribute, the higher a deduction you can take from your income)
- employer's matched amount is *excepted* from income (ie. it is not included as part of your income)

deduction is limited to 18% of employee's earnings

RRSP (employer has nothing to do with this; only employee will ever contribute to RRSP; even if unemployed, you can still add to RRSP of your own free will)

#### Example

correct answer: $122,000

- if you benefit most from the expense, it is likely *not deductible* (eg. company-paid vacation); if you do not really personally benefit but rather it is necessary for work, it is likely *deductible* (eg. salesperson's car expenses)
-

#### Example

- *Professional due paid by the employee to CPA Canada.* Can be deducted because the expense is work-related.
- *Gym membership paid by the employer.* Included in income because the expense largely benefits employee rather than for work purposes.
- *Business trip paid by the employer.* Can be deducted because the expense is work-related.
- *Home internet paid by the employee.* Unless for home office, the expense benefits the employee, is not related to work, therefore cannot be deducted.

### STOCK OPTIONS

= the right to purchase shares at a given price (lower than market price)

- exercise price = price that you are able to purchase shares at (which is lower than market price)
- FMV at exercise = market price of shares when shares are exercised
- price of disposition = price that you eventually sell the shares at

the discount of your purchase is part of your employment income (subject to a likely [division c deduction](#division-c-deduction-for-stock-options)).

employees who receive stock options will eventually receive both employment income and capital gains

- FMV at exercise – exercise price = included in your employment income
- FMV at disposition – FMV at exercise = capital gains; not relevant to employment income

three dates of importance:

1. grant date = day on which the option is granted to the employee. no tax implications.
1. exercise date = day on which employee purchases the shares at a discount (exercising their option). possible tax implications depending on your employer:
  - if working for public corporation: must include the discount in the employment income of the year that the shares are exercised. EMPLOYMENT INCOME has been received.
  - if working for CCPC, has a benefit: can defer recognition of the discount *until disposition of shares*
1. selling date = day on which employee disposes of the shares (by selling them). a CAPITAL GAIN (LOSS) has been realized.
  - for CCPC employee, this is also when their employment income is recognized.

### DIVISION C DEDUCTION FOR STOCK OPTIONS

1/2 of employment income from stock options can be deducted if:

- from public corp: cannot be in-the-money
- from CCPC: either cannot be in-the-money, or must hold for at least two years before exercising (doesn't have to meet both criteria)

- in-the-money: exercise price is already lower than FMV *on the day the options are granted* (not exercise date)
  - ie. if you exercise them right away on the same day as they are granted, you're guaranteed to make money
- out-of-money: on the grant date, the exercise price is higher than FMV
- at-the-money: exercise price = exercise price *is the same as* FMV on the grant date
  - this is the *most common type of stock option* (eg. a company grants stock options at the market price today, the assumption is you will hold onto them for a while as they gain value, then when you exercise them, you will be able to buy at a discount)

note that, the only benefit received by CCPC employees is a matter of *timing*, not amount: the amount of income inclusion is the same for both groups of employees.

#### Example: *5 options to purchase 20 shares each at $12. FMV at grant date is $10. Exercise when FMV is $15. Sell when FMV is $19.*

this is an out-of-money stock option grant.

note that we used the FMV-at-exercise to calculate capital gains, rather than the exercise price of $12. otherwise part of the employment income would've been taxed twice.

*Tax implications for a public corporation?*

- must report as employment income the discount on your purchase on the day you exercise the option
- must report as capital gain (loss) the profit you make on selling your shares on the day you dipose of them
- if options were granted out-of-money or at-the-money, you can deduct 50% of the employment income amount

*For a CCPC?*

- can defer recognition of the employment income until the year you dispose of the shares
- if you take the deferral option, you will incur employment income and capital gain (loss) in the same year
- if options were granted out-of-money or at-the-money, or you hold the options for at least two years, you can deduct 50% of the employment income amount

### AUTOMOBILE BENEFITS

typically, an employer-provided vehicle will be used for both personal and business use. CRA seeks to tax the benefit arising from the personal use portion.

definition of automobile *excludes*:
  - rail or trolley cars
  - emergency vehicles (police, fire, ambulance)
  - taxis, hearses, and vehicle inventory.
  - but if you do drive one of these excepted vehicles, you still have a taxable benefit (there is no strict calculation; any reasonable approach to determining the value of the benefit is acceptable)

- standby charge = benefit received from having a company-owned or -leased capital asset available for use
  - A/B × (2% × (C×D) + 2/3 × (E–F))
  - if owned, use: A/B × 2% × C×D
  - if leasing, use: A/B × 2/3 × (E–F)
  - A/B
    - A = lesser of B or the total personal-use km driven during the period when the car was available
    - B = 1,667 km × (total days car was available / 30, rounding to closest month) (will be 20,004 km if available for whole year)
    - when personal use <50%, A/B has to be manually calculated. when personal use >50%, A/B automatically becomes 1.
    - the larger A/B is, the more taxable benefits you will be considered to have received (ie. the more you will be taxed)
  - 2% = CRA says for each month you use the vehicle, you consume ~2% of its value (therefore you must be taxed on the 2%)
  - C×D (applies if company-*owned*)
    - C = full original cost (including HST) of employer-owned automobile
    - D = total days car was available / 30 (will be 12 if available for whole year)
  - E–F (applies if company-*leased*)
    - E = lease payments (including HST) made by employer
    - F = portion of the lease payments that relates to insurance
- operating benefit = benefit received as a result of the employer paying for the vehicle's operating expenses on employee's behalf
  - operating expenses include gas, insurance, maintenance, but not parking
  - prescribed by CRA to be: for each personal-use km, 28¢ of benefits paid by employer to you
  - if personal use is more than 50%, use formula = $0.28 * personal-use km
  - if personal use is less than 50%, can use the same formula above OR 1/2 of standby charge (if you wanna use this method, must inform your employer in writing before end of the tax year)

** exam questions will not deal with partial-year automobile benefit calculations (so you can always use B = 20,0004 and D = 12)

the worst is if you drive a car for like 10 km and 8 of those are personal use, then you'll end up paying a lot of tax for barely any personal benefit.

also, you'll be taxed a lot more if you use it slightly more for personal use than business use, so try to use at least slightly more than 50% for business.

if you have to reimburse employer for using the vehicle, these reimbursements count as deductions to the automobile income inclusion, but you must do it within 45 days of the end of the tax year.

what if *you the employee* own the vehicle, but your employer reimburses you for operating costs?

- pro-rate the total costs paid by employer by (personal use / total use) ratio = amount to be included in employment income as an automobile benefit
- you will have to keep detailed logs of your personal-use and business-use km driven

#### Example:

Jane

### RPP DEFINED BENEFIT VS DEFINED CONTRIBUTION

defined benefit (benefit to you the employee is the same regardless of plan performance)

- big risk for employer because if plan investment does poorly in the market, they must still pay you the same amount
- employer may lose money if investment is bad
- but all contributions by either employer or employee are deductible

defined contribution aka money purchase (more commonly used, it's less expensive for the employer):

- risk is taken on by employee—market decides how much your RPP earns, employer doesn't have to make it up to you if the investment is bad
- if plan performs poorly, the employee is paid less
- combined employer and employee contributions cannot exceed LESSER OF:
  - 18% of employment income
  - $27,230 for 2019

## L5 & 6: Business Income (Chapter 4)

difference between calculating employment income and business income:

- for individuals, start with 0. a bunch of different sources of income, but only a few exceptions (ie. only employment-related expenses)
- for businesses, start with income for accounting purposes. only one source of income, but a lot of different exceptions


### Division B Subdivision B: Income or Loss from a Business or Property (focusing on Business)

- sec. 9 = basic rules for determining business income
- sec. 12 = income inclusions
- sec. 18 = deductions: limitations
  - any deductions must be for expenses made to produce income
- sec. 20 = deductions: permitted
  - sometimes a deduction that would generally be prohibited under sec. 18 will have special allowances in sec. 20
  - therefore, sec. 20 itemizes overrides to sec. 18
  - this section also includes some reserves that may be used to reduce the amounts in sec. 12
- sec. 67 = a safeguard that allows CRA to reduce any deductible expense to a reasonable amount
  - eg. this section states that only 50% of meals and entertainment expense is deductible

### DISTINGUISHING BUSINESS INCOME VS PROPERTY INCOME VS CAPITAL GAINS

- business income = involves regular and continuous activity. *active* involvement.
- property income = *passive* generation of earnings. very little activity required.
  - eg. rental income, dividend income, interest income, royalties income, bonds income
- capital gains = involves selling *capital* assets (ie. not something that is typically sold in the regular course of the company's business)
  - eg. if company is selling machines regularly, then that can be considered its inventory and result in business income. but if a company is selling off an old machine, and its regular business doesn't involve the selling of these machines, then that can be considered its capital asset and result in a capital gain (loss).

why separate these different types of income?

- calculating RRSP contribution limits (passive income except for rental income is not used in the calculation for RRSP limits)
- calculating child care expenses deductions (all property income is not eligible for deducting child care expenses from because it is not "earned income")
- applying CCA (CCA cannot create a loss for rental income)
- small business deduction and other business-related deductions should not be applied to property income
- non-resident taxpayers have withholding tax for property income, but not for business income.

just because you're a corporation doesn't mean you only earn business income. a corporation that principally earns property income, all of that income is not considered *business income* but rather *passive income* UNLESS it employs more than five full-time employees.

investment income is typically considered property income *unless* the property was used directly to produce active business income, eg:

- interest on A/R
- interest on short-term investments
- rental income from renting an otherwise unused portion of the manufacturing premises (note: not just a random building that the company leases out to earn income, but rather a building that they use for their regular business)

### FISCAL PERIODS FOR REPORTING

- proprietorships, professional corporations, partnership must use calendar year as tax year
  - exception: if sole proprietorship, can file an election by the individual tax return deadline.
    - not intended to help business defer income, but rather recognizes that there are *non-tax* reasons to have an off-calendar year end.
    - must use a formula that essentially estimates your income if you *were* using a calendar year end
    - eg. if your proprietorship has a Jan 31, 2019 year-end, you must report your actual income for Jan 31 2018 - Jan 31 2019, then *add* an estimated income for Feb 1-Dec 31 2019, and *subtract* the estimated income included on the last return (Feb 1-Dec 31 2018).
  - partnerships are not taxable entities but they must file an annual information return called "Statement of Partnership Income" and each partner must report their share of partnership income on their individual returns

### GAAP VS TAX

even though for FS, GAAP is used (either ASPE or IFRS), there are differences between GAAP calculation of income and calculation for tax purposes.

eg. if cash is received for an upcoming service, this would be considered "Unearned/Deferred Revenue" in GAAP, but CRA would consider it part of actual income for that year.

in calculating taxable income, we begin with *net income for accounting purposes*. then we make inclusions and deductions to arrive at the income for tax purposes, called "Schedule 1 Reconciliation:"

- start with accounting net income
- subtract income that is not taxable but was considered income under GAAP
- add income that is taxable but not considered income under GAAP
- add (reverse) expenses that are non-deductible under tax but were considered expenses under GAAP
- subtract (include) expenses that are deductible under tax but not considered expenses under GAAP
- = business income for tax purposes

permanent vs temporary differences:

- permanent differences = differences that will always be treated differently under tax vs accounting
  - eg. fines and penalties (will be expensed under accounting, but cannot be deducted on tax return), meals and entertainment expense, etc.
- temporary differences = a matter of timing. both accounting and tax treatments will eventually recognize the same amounts, but at different times.
  - eg. depreciation methods may differ (straight-line is usually used for most accounting purposes, but CRA allows use of accelerated method).

### BUSINESS INCOME INCLUSIONS

- business income is treated on a more accrual basis than employment income, so any A/R created during the tax year is included in income (except fishers and farmers, and professionals when the A/R relates to work in progress)
- unearned aka deferred revenue is also considered part of that year's income
- barter transactions aka "payments in kind"
  - include FMV of the good or service received in income (aka what you got in the exchange)
  - deduct the FMV of what you provided to the other party (aka what it cost you)
  - contrast with a voluntary and gratuitous transfer of property with no expectation of reward, which is a *non-taxable gift*
- allowance for doubtful accounts and allowance for warranties must be added back to accounting net income (although under sec. 20 there may be some possibilty of reserves)


#### ILLEGAL BUSINESS INCOME

- income from illegal business activities is taxable
- expenses incurred to earn that illegal income is also deductible
  - except: illegal payments to canadian govt officials or fare collectors or those with a fiduciary duty where the intent of the payments were to make that person breach their duty

#### INCOME FROM GAMBLING OR WINDFALLS

- money made from recreational gambling or betting is not taxable
  - but a professional gambler (evidenced by if they have a system for risk management) will have their winnings taxed (and losses would be deductible)
  - a bookie would be taxable as well because they are carrying on a business
- windfall = a sum that the recipient never expected to receive
  - eg. winning the lottery - not taxable because the winner had no expectation of winning it

### BUSINESS INCOME DEDUCTIONS

criteria for something to be deductible according to sec. 18:

1. deductible under GAAP (financial accounting rules)
  - eg. prepaid expenses are not considered expenses under GAAP, therefore not deductible
1. not a capital expenditure
  - if it is, use CCA to claim some credits each year
  - exception: landscaping, although it is treated as a capital expenditure under financial accounting, the entire amount is deductible under tax purposes
1. was incurred to gain *taxable* income
  - eg. life insurance for executives is deductible—the company suffers a loss if a key executive dies, so life insurance is an expenditure that can be considered to be spent to earn income for the company
  - eg. charitable donations do not directly lead to more income for the company, so cannot be deducted under Division B (but can be under Div C as an incentive)
  - doesn't necessarily have to actually have earned income, as long as the expectation was there
1. not a personal expense or expenditure
  - personal and living expenses are not deductible, eg. traveling expenses for a business trip are deductible but if it is extended to become a vacation, those additional expenses as a result of the vacation are non-deductible.
1. reasonable in the circumstances
  - compare the expenditure to the amount of similar expenditures made by other taxpayers in similar situations

prohibitions and restrictions on deductions:

- [illegal payments](#illegal-business-income)
- fines and penalties imposed by law (included those of foreign countries); HOWEVER, penalties and damages paid under private contracts, incurred in the ordinary course of business, *are* deductible.
- expenses incurred to earn exempt income (you're not being taxed on that portion of income, so why should you be allowed to take deductions?)
- GST/HST (because an input tax credit is provided that wipes out the GST/HST cost; therefore, deducting it would be double-counting)
- property impairment
- stock option expenses
- amortization expense
- estimated environmental cleanup costs calculated under GAAP
- capital expenditures
- reserves for contingent liabilities
  - until the day that the event that triggers the liability actually happens, the reserve for the liability is not deductible.
  - variation: a liability that is unconditional today but *may be reduced* in the future, can typically be deducted now, UNLESS it is reasonable to believe the taxpayer will trigger a future event that would reduce the liability. then that liability is treated as a conditional liability (ie. not deductible)
- payments on discounted bonds
  - prohibiting a deduction in the amount of the discount is done to prevent the debtor from issuing a large discount to provide the holder of the debt a more advantageous capital gains treatment
- recreational facilities and club dues
  - no matter how important they are in earning revenue for the business, they are prohibited from deduction.
  - includes use/maintenance of a yacht, camp, lodge, or golf course, even if it is to entertain clients; UNLESS making these facilities available to public use is in the course of regular business (aka yacht tours company)
  - does not apply to expenses incurred in respect to a hotel or restaurant, or other amenities of a golf club that is not its golf course (eg. use of its banquet halls, lounges, etc. are deductible)
- political contributions
- automobile allowances paid to employees are only deductible up to 58cents / km for the first 5,000 km and 52cents thereafter (+ 4cents for the territories) UNLESS the allowance is included in the employee's income (then all of it is deductible)
- prepaid expenses
- expenses of administering sheltered investment plans (eg. retirement plans where income is not taxed as long as it stays in the plan)

permitted deductions:

- CCA
- first $3,000/year of incorporation expenses is deductible even though it's generally regarded as a capital expenditure
- reserves
- interest is deductible (even though, since it's usually incurred through financing to buy assets, should be a capital expenditure)
- expenses of issuing shares or borrowing money (eg. legal and accounting fees, registration and transfer fees, commissions or bonuses, refinancing costs)
- disability-related modifications and equipment
- company's contribution to RPP
- fees associated with cancelling a lease
- landscaping (although capitalized under accounting, it can be entirely expensed under tax)
- conventions (up to 2/year)
- expenses of issuing

## L7 & L8: CCA (Chapter 5)

accounting amortization allows room for professional judgement, but amortization under tax has strict rules for each asset class (to increase neutrality)

- accounting amortization uses *useful life* as the basis for write-offs
- CCA uses *useful life* or *legal life* (patents, etc.) or *fiscal policy* (more favourable CCA rates for actions the govt wants to incentivize)

non-depreciable property is not covered under the Tax Act (therefore not eligible for CCA)

depreciable property is defined in the Tax Act as property where CCA is allowed to be claimed

capital gains can be recognized on disposition since depreciable property = capital property, but capital losses are *always disallowed*

### CCA ELIGIBILITY

property must be:

- depreciable under CCA or Schedule II
- not specifically excluded under a Regulation

exclusions (not depreciable under CCA):

- property whose cost is deductible from income (eg. landscaping)
- inventory
- property that was not acquired for producing income
- yacht, camp, lodge, or golf course
- land
- property outside of Canada and owned by non-residents

employees cannot claim CCA except on the following (and in each case, the employee must be using the property to perform employment duties):

- motor vehicle costs (employee-provided car)
  - belongs in class 10 (car costing less than $30,000) or 10.1 (luxury cars)
  - for class 10 cars:
    - any CCA recapture must be included in employment income
    - any terminal loss cannot be deducted
  - for class 10.1 cars:
    - no recapture *or* terminal loss is to be applied
    - in the year of disposition of the vehicle, 1/2 of the CCA that would have been allowed for the vehicle is allowed to be deducted
- aircraft costs
- musical instrument costs]

notice that use of employee-owned computer or home office equipment are not deductible under CCA; therefore, to recognize depreciation on these items, employer and employee should look at other alternatives that are deductible in other sections (eg. leasing arrangement or independent contractor arrangement)

### AMOUNT OF CCA TO DEDUCT

can deduct less than the maximum CCA allowable (= CCA rate of an asset class * balance in the class at year-end), and claim that leftover deduction in a future year

### WHEN TO START CLAIMING CCA

- can only start deducting CCA when property becomes "available for use" to the taxpayer, ie. when it is delivered and capable of performing its expected function
- earlier of:
  - when all or substantial part of the building is first used for its intended purpose
  - second tax year after year of acquisition

### ASSET CLASSES

- 1 = 4%: most buildings including their components (eg. electrical wiring, fixtures, plumbing, heating, central AC system)
- 1-MB = 10%: manufacturing buildings where at least 90% of the surface area is used for manufacturing or processing purposes
  - acquired on or after Mar 19 2007
  - not used by anyone before Mar 19 2007
  - each building in this class is added to its own separate class
- 1-NRB = 6%: non-residential buildings
  - acquired on or after Mar 19 2007
  - not used by anyone before Mar 19 2007
  - each building added to own separate class
- 8 = 20%: miscellaneous *tangible* property
  - eg. furniture, fixtures, signs, machinery and equipment (photocopiers, refrigerators, telephones, tools costing $500+, etc.)
  - this is the default class for tangible property (ie. stuff that doesn't belong in any other class goes here)
- 10 = 30%: automotive equipment
- 10.1 = 30%: passenger vehicle that costs more than $30,000 (luxury vehicles)
  - each vehicle added to own separate class
- 12 = 100%:
  - tools, instruments, kitchen utensils less than $500
  - linen and uniforms
  - dies, jigs, molds
  - rental videocassettes
  - computer application software (ie. most software except those that belong in class 50)
  - no half-year rule for most assets in this class
- 13: lease hold interest
  - uses straight-line because there is a known, finite life of asset
- 14: patent, franchise, concession or license that expires after a set period
  - no half-year rule
  - AI applies
  - uses straight-line (except those in class 14.1) because patents, licenses, etc. have a known finite life
- 17 = 8%: roads, parking lots, sidewalks, runways, storage facilities
- 43 = 30%: machinery and equipment used primarily to manufacture goods for sale or lease
  - must be located in canada
- 43.1 = 30%: clean energy equipment
  - electrical energy storages
  - solar heating equipment
  - wind energy conversion systems
  - gothermal energy equipment
  - electrical vehicle charging stations
- 44 = 25%: patents or rights to use patented information (for either limited or unlimited period)
- 50 = 55%: data processing equipment and systems software for that equipment
- 53 = 50%: manufacturing and processing equipment acquired between 2015-2026
  - anything acquired after 2025 belongs in class 43

rental properties costing > $50,000 must be included in its own separate class to ensure recognition of income recapture from sale of each individual building

classes 43.1, 43.2, 53 acquired after Nov 2018 - Jan 1 2028 benefit from an enhanced first year CCA rate.

- 100% for property acquired between Nov 20 2018 - Dec 31 2023
- 75% for property acquired between Jan 1 2024 - Dec 31 2025
- 55% for property acquired between Jan 1 2026 - Dec 31 2027
- N/A (back to regular CCA rate) for Jan 1 and beyond

### CALCULATING CCA

1. start with UCC of the class at beginning of year
1. add purchases made during the year:
  - eligible property (EP)
  - non-eligible property (NEP)
1. deduct dispositions during the year:
  - using lesser of cost or proceeds (LOCP)
1. = adjusted UCC
1. adjustments (if adjusted UCC is positive):
  - add: accelerated investment incentive = 50% of (EP - (disposition - NEP))
  - deduct: half-year rule = 1/2 * (NEP - dispositions)
1. calculate maximum CCA = UCC * CCA rate
1. UCC at end of year (aka beginning of next year) = deduct maximum CCA as calculated above from adjusted UCC
1. if UCC bal is now negative, add that bal back into income as *recaptured CCA* (so UCC for that class becomes 0)
1. if UCC is positive, but there are no more assets left in the class, deduct that bal from income as a *terminal loss* (so UCC for that class becomes 0)

when to claim a capital gain vs income recapture vs terminal loss?

![cca disposition](/resources/uw/images/ccadisposition.jpg){:width="100%"}

### ACCELERATED INVESTMENT INCENTIVE (AI)

encourages businesses to actively invest in *new* depreciable assets, by increasing how much CCA can be deducted the first year an eligible property is put into use

two benefits of AI:

1. half-year rule will not be applied to AI-eligible assets from now to 2028
1. can claim 1.5x the CCA rate for eligible purchases made during the year
  - eg. if an AI-eligible property is acquired in class 8, can claim 20% * 1.5 = 30% of CCA (for the first year only)

note that AI doesn't change the total CCA deductible from a property, but increases the amount that can be deducted in the *first year* (thus *accelerating* it.)

non-AI-eligible property:

- class 43.1, 43.2, 53 (these classes already benefit from full expensing)
- any used property that was acquired from a non-arm's length person, or previously acquired by taxpayer
- any property acquired from someone who is not dealing at arm's length, if both conditions are met:
  1. property was depreciable property of the transferor
  1. property was owned continuously by transferor from a day that was at least 365 days before the end of the tax year of the acquirer in which the property was acquired

### HALF-YEAR RULE

the half-year rule is a catch-all for purchases of depreciable property made during the year, because it wouldn't be fair for those properties to be able to experience maximum CCA deduction. simplifies calculations because you don't have to prorate for the exact length of ownership.

exclusions from half-year rule:

- certain class 12 properties:
  - library book
  - tableware and cutlery
  - tools and kitchen utensils less than $500
  - medical/dental equipment less than $500
  - linen and uniforms
  - rental apparel or costumes
- all class 14 properties

CCA = capital cost allowance
UCC = unrecovered capital cost
LOCP = lower of cost and proceeds

non depreciables (eg. paintings, securities)

- start with UCC at beginning of year
- add: purchases in the year
- deduct: dispositions in the year (LOCP)
- = adjusted UCC
- make first-year adjustments:
  - accelerated investment incentive for EP
  - if net changes are positive (more purchases than dispositions), deduct: half-year rule for NEP (50% * net additions in the year)
- calculate maximum CCA = CCA rate * adjusted UCC (NOT including first-year adjustments)
- calculate UCC at end of year = UCC - CCA

note that first-year adjustments are only used to calculate max allowable CCA for the year, not the UCC balance

for CCA, don't include HST in the cost of assets

Sched 1 Reconciliation

- add back: depreciation or amortization (under accounting), loss on disposal (under accounting), provision for income taxes (not an allowable reserve), writedowns of capital assets (not an allowable deduction)
- add: recapture, taxable capital gains, deduct allowable capital losses
- deduct: CCA, terminal loss, gain on disposal (under accounting)

## L10 & L11 (Chapter 6: Income from Property)

differentiating property from business income is mostly based on how *actively* the taxpayer earns the income: eg. interest income earned by a capital market bond trader would be business income; interest income earned by someone who simply invests in bonds would be property income.

income or loss from a property *does not include* capital gains and losses

### Division B Subdivision B: Income or Loss from a Business or Property (focusing on Property)

- sec. 9 = income or loss from a property
- sec. 12 = inclusions
- sec. 13 = CCA rules
- sec. 15 = shareholder benefits
- sec. 18 = deductions: limitations
- sec. 20 = deductions: permitted (overrides rules in sec. 18)

### INVESTMENT INCOME = PROPERTY INCOME

some property income sources provide information slips (T3, T5, T600, etc.) but other sources (eg. rental income) don't, so it's the taxpayer's responsibility to record all sources of income.

### CALCULATING INCOME

- corporations must use *accrual* method to calculate interest on debt obligations
  - debt obligations include bank accounts, term deposites, guaranteed investment certificates, mortgages, corporate bonds, loans
- interest income must be reported at the earlier of:
  - the year it has actually been received (cash)
  - the year it became legally due (accrual)
    - compounding interest will have to be included in income in the year that it was compounded, even if you don't actually receive any of it in cash that year
    - disadvantage for compounding-interest debt securities: you may have a tax payable on an accrued interest amount, even if you don't actually receive that amount

### DIVIDEND INCOME

two kinds of dividends:

- cash dividend = distribution of profits in cash
- dividend in kind = distribution of profits in something other than cash
  - taxed the same way as cash dividend, using the FMV of the item received
  - (exception: stock dividends have special treatment)

any income earned from a corporation that is distributed pro rata among shareholders is considered a dividend, unless the corporation can prove otherwise.

- dividends from canadian resident corporations: known as "taxable dividends"
  - taxable dividend = any dividend that is not a tax-free capital dividend or a qualifying dividend on tax deferred shares
- dividends from nonresident corporations: known simply as "dividends"
- deemed dividends (withdrawal of money by shareholders from corporation or other benefits to shareholders) may or may not be taxed, specific rules are in the Act

### DOUBLE TAXATION OF DIVIDENDS

corporations who receive dividends are not taxed on that income.

if you are an *individual* who receives dividend income from a corporation, you essentially get double taxed:

- interest expense is deducted from income of a corporation (before-tax income), therefore no double taxation of the interest income earned by the payees, while dividends are *not* (after-tax income)
- thus, if you get taxed on your dividend income, that income is getting double taxed (the corporation was taxed on it, then you got taxed when the corp passed it on to you)

dividend tax credit (DTC) is a Division E credit that offsets the income tax already paid by the corporation:

1. restore the pre-tax dividend amount by adding a gross-up amount (= the DTC)
  - if received from a public corporation (*eligible* dividends) = 38% gross-up rate
  - if received from a CCPC (*non-eligible* dividends) = 15% gross-up rate
  - why do dividends received from public corps get a higher DTC? because public corps are subject to a higher tax rate
1. compute individual's tax using the *pre-tax* dividend as a basis
1. deduct DTC (= gross-up amount) from the tax calculated

amount of DTC you can claim is split between federal and provincial (some of DTC is offered by fed, some is offered by provincial)

perfect integration:

- purpose of DTC is to make individuals indifferent as to whether they earn income directly (proprietorship or partnership), from a public corporation, or CCPC, because theoretically one will receive the same after-tax net earnings no matter which they choose.
- IRL, due to the CRA's assumptions of 38% and 15%, integration will be *imperfect* but *close to perfect*

what about dividends received from non-resident (foreign) corporations?

- no gross-up or DTC to be applied
- however, an FTC may be available
1. simply add back the amount of tax withheld by the foreign tax authority
1. calculate tax on the pre-tax dividend amount
1. deduct the amount of tax withheld by foreign tax authority from the tax owing
1. in summary: canadian tax = (dividend received + foreign tax withheld) × individual's tax rate – foreign tax withheld

### NON-DEDUCTIBLE EXPENSES

- expenses on vacant land (eg. mortgage interest, property taxes) are only deductible against net income earned from that land
  - this is to discourage real estate speculation (holding onto land for the sole purpose of selling it for capital gains later, with no interest in using or developing it)
  - any carrying charges that are in excess of net income (and thus non-deductible) are added to the cost base of the land, which will reduce the capital gain on that land when it is sold
  - exception: if the land is only vacant for part of the year, then is used, the costs are fully deductible

### RENTAL INCOME

treatment of CCA:

- income recapture or terminal loss from CCA is included in rental income
- yearly CCA can be included in rental expenses and deducted, unless it creates a net rental loss or increases the existing loss
  - note this is different from business income, in which CCA *can* create a business loss
  - this is to prevent abuse of CCA by houseowners who want to take CCA on their own house to reduce their total tax liability, by "renting" it out but earning little or no income from the "rental"

eligible expenses that can be deducted from rental income:

- maintenance
- insurance
- utilities
- property tax
- mortgage interest
- CCA (subject to rule above)

### CAPITAL LOSSES

- can be used to offset capital gains
- *cannot* offset ordinary income (ie. employment, business, property)
  - this is to limit the amount of risk taken by investors
- if your CY capital loss exceeds CY capital gains, can carryback up to 3 years or carryforward indefinitely until it's used up
  - if carryback, you must request a reassessment of the year you are carrying back to. then you will get a refund on the amount of tax you paid on capital gains that year that you are now offsetting
