### TAX INSTALMENTS

- Must pay instalments if in at least one of last two prior years you had non-withheld tax *liability* (not income) over $3,000

For individuals, three ways to calculate tax instalments:

1. CY Option: For each Q, pay 1/4 of instalment
1. PY Option
1. 2nd PY Option: For Q1 and Q2, 1/4 of non-withheld tax liability from two years ago; for Q3 and Q4, 1/2 of (PY - (Q1 + Q2 payments))

Option 2 and 3 will result in the same *total* instalment payments each year.

But! Option 1 is dangerous because if you underestimate your tax liability (and as a result don't pay enough instalments), you are liable for interest. If you use Option 2 or 3, you are safe from interest and penalties even if your actual liability turns out to be higher than prior years.

For corporations, Option 3: For M1 and M2, 1/12 of liability from two years ago; for M3-M12, 1/10 of (PY - (M1 + M2 payments))

(Interest and penalty calculations don't need to be memorized)

#### Chapter 14 Assignment Problem 6

1. $3,750
1. Option 2: 5,753
1. 4,502 for M1 and M2; $6,003.20 for M3-M12
