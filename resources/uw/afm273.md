## Terminology

- n or nper = number of periods that cash flows happen in (eg. pay rent monthly for a year, n = 12; pay rent annually for a year, n = 1)
- P = principal (PV of the initial cash flow)
- pmt = payment per period (for annuities or perpetuities)

### THREE RULES OF TIME TRAVEL

1. only values in the same units on the same date can be compared or combined
  - $1 today cannot be compared to $1 last year
  - so if you want to compare, you must move one to the same point in time as the other
1. you must compound or discount a cash flow to move it in time
  - use the market interest rate as an "exchange rate" to convert the cash flow to a different time "currency"
  - multiply (if moving forward) or divide (if moving backward) the cash flow by (1 + r)^number of periods difference
    - C0(1+r)^n
    - eg. to find the FV of $1,000 in two years, assuming 10% interest rate = $1,000 * (1.10)^2 = $1,210

### SIMPLE VS COMPOUNDED INTEREST

- simple interest = interest is only ever earned on the principal, not on any accrued interest
  - interest amount will be the same every period
  - cumulative income is linear
- compound interest (more common in investments) = interest is earned on principal + accrued interest
  - interest increases after every period
  - cumulative income is geometric aka exponential

### NPV

NPV = PV(benefits – costs)

1. move all cash flows (benefits and costs) to the same point in time by discounting or compounding
1. subtract the costs (outflows) from the benefits (inflows)

#### Example 4.6 NPV of an Investment Opportunity

*You have been offered the following investment opportunity: If you invest $1000 today, you will receive $500 at the end of each of the next three years. If you could otherwise earn 10% per year on your money, should you undertake the investment opportunity?*

always start with a timeline to help visualize (comes in way handy for future more complex problems)

![npv timeline](/resources/uw/images/npv.jpg){:width="50%"}

NPV = PV of benefits ($500/1.10 + $500/1.10^2 + $500/1.10^3) – PV of costs ($1,000) = $243.43

therefore, take the opportunity as you will earn $243.43 in present value

### REGULAR VS GROWING ANNUITIES / PERPETUITIES

- regular perpetuity = stream of *equal* cash flows that occur at constant intervals, lasts *forever*
- regular annuity = stream of *equal* cash flows that occur at constant intervals, *ends* after a fixed number of intervals
- growing perpetuity = stream of *growing (at a constant rate)* cash flows that occur at constant intervals, lasts forever
- growing annuity = stream of *growing (at a constant rate)* cash flows that occur at constant intervals, ends after a fixed number of periods

### PV OF A REGULAR PERPETUITY

how can we calculate the PV of a perpetuity if it goes on forever? because the cash flows far in the future are so heavily discounted that they become negligible to the total

1. invest P into a perpetuity
1. receive interest (C = P * interest rate) every period, and P remains unreturned
1. PV of receiving C forever = P = C/r

therefore, PV of a perpetuity = P = C/r

### PV OF A REGULAR ANNUITY

1. invest P into a perpetuity
1. receive interest (C = P * r) every period until n
1. PV = C * 1/r (1 – 1/(1+r)^n)

- cash arrives at the end of each period (so no payment at Date 0); this is called *payment in arrears* (or just referred to as an annuity)
- there is also *annuity due* (in which the first payment is at Date 0)

### EAR (EFFECTIVE ANNUAL RATE) VS APR (ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE)

EAR is more commonly used, more straightforward

- EAR gives the total amount of interest to be earned at the end of one year (which will grow each year as it compounds)
- must adjust EAR to match the frequency of cash flows; eg. %5 EAR = %2.47 effective six-month rate, = 10.25% effective two-year rate
- formula for converting one effective rate to another that covers a different length of time:
  - equivalent effective *n* rate = (1 + r)^n - 1
  - can be used not only for EAR (annual), also for any other kind of effective n-period rate
  - if the length of each period is greater than the period given in the known effective rate, n > 1; if it's shorter, n < 1

APR is often used by banks to quote rates; indicates how much *simple interest* is earned at the end of one year

- does not include compounding effect, so it will be less than the amount of interest that the same amount of money will actually earn
- cannot use APR directly as a discount rate
- to be useable, first must convert APR to EAR
- eg. suppose a bank has a savings account with interest of "4% per year with quarterly compounding"
  - use =EFFECT function convert APR to EAR → notice that the EAR = 4.06% so slightly higher than what you would get with simple interest (APR)

use =PMT function in excel to calculate how the periodic cash flows required

On an industry level, No
