## Terminology

- n or nper = number of periods that cash flows happen in (eg. pay rent monthly for a year, n = 12; pay rent annually for a year, n = 1)
- P = principal (PV of the initial cash flow)

### THREE RULES OF TIME TRAVEL

1. only values in the same units on the same date can be compared or combined
  - $1 today cannot be compared to $1 last year
  - so if you want to compare, you must move one to the same point in time as the other
1. you must compound or discount a cash flow to move it in time
  - use the market interest rate as an "exchange rate" to convert the cash flow to a different time "currency"
  - multiply (if moving forward) or divide (if moving backward) the cash flow by (1 + r)^number of periods difference
    - C0(1+r)^n
    - eg. to find the FV of $1,000 in two years, assuming 10% interest rate = $1,000 * (1.10)^2 = $1,210

### SIMPLE VS COMPOUNDED INTEREST

- simple interest = interest is only ever earned on the principal, not on any accrued interest
  - interest amount will be the same every period
  - cumulative income is linear
- compound interest (more common in investments) = interest is earned on principal + accrued interest
  - interest increases after every period
  - cumulative income is geometric aka exponential
