## Chapter 1

### WHAT IS ACCOUNTING

- Financial accounting = aka financial reporting; providing information to external parties eg. shareholders
- Managerial accounting = provide info *within* enterprise
- Tax accounting = providing info on taxable amounts to government revenue agency

### SUPPLY AND DEMAND

- accounting is an *economic good*, and is subject to laws of supply and demand
- thus accounting standards are not arbitrarily set by the governing bodies but by the *demand for financial information* and the ability of enterprises to *supply the demanded information*

### INFORMATION ASYMMETRY

- external parties make decisions regarding the enterprise *under uncertainty*, which leads to the demand for financial reporting to help them predict outcomes
- information = evidence that can *potentially affect* someone's decisions (doesn't necessarily alter the decision, but it could)
- some evidence can be information to one person but not information to someone else (who has a different decision context)
- information asymmetry = some people have more information than others regarding performance of an enterprise

#### P1-2. Supply and demand for accounting information (L.O. 1–1) (Easy – 10 minutes)

*In the context of an entrepreneur seeking an initial public offering (IPO) of shares in her company, discuss the concepts of uncertainty, information asymmetry, and the supply of and demand for information.*

investors have an information disadvantage because up to this point, the company has been private and little information regarding its operations, performance, or profitability have been divulged. investors would want to pay the lowest price for these shares, then, because they have no basis on which to value the shares and would logically assume they are worthless. to buy shares, they demand information that would help them predict the company's future performance and assess whether the shares would go up in value. the entrepreneur would have to supply credible information to meet these demands, likely having to prepare financial statements audited independently for maximum credibility.

#### P1-3. Supply and demand for accounting information (L.O. 1–1) (Easy – 10 minutes)

*Discuss the concepts of uncertainty, information asymmetry, and the supply of and demand for information when a corporation applies for a bank loan.*

the corporation management has an information advantage over the loan officers, who would be unwilling to extend credit if they do not know about the riskiness of lending money to the corporation and how likely it is to be able to repay the loan. the corporation must supply credible financial information demanded by the bank to assess its future liquidity, such as projected cash flows and financial ratios.

### ADVERSE SELECTION aka *hidden information*

when one party to a contract has more *information* than the other party (eg. when investors are deciding whether or not to buy shares in a company or lenders are deciding whether or not to extend credit, they have less information than mgmt of the company)

- adverse selection causes investors to be way of overpaying (since they have information asymmetry against them): therefore, without information, they will only be willing to pay the lowest price
- thus, company wants to provide information that persuades you to purchase their shares at a higher price
- **demand: for information related to investment decisions**

companies must provide evidence to potential investors that their share prices are worth something.

- cheap talk vs credible evidence:
  - cheap talk is a unverifiable claim (eg. "these shares are underpriced"), which is useless.
  - credible evidence includes financial statements. often requires independent auditors to provide third-party testimony to the company's performance.
- companies can also use a *costly signal* (something that is expensive for the company), like dividends, which signal that the company has enough cash flows to pay out dividends.

### MORAL HAZARD aka *hidden actions*

when one party to a contract cannot observe some *actions* of the other party in fulfilling the contract

- mgmt has motivation to *exaggerate* company's perceived performance (earnings management)
- but mgmt is also the provider of information
- thus, investors and lenders want to insure the information received is credible
- **demand: for information that is verifiable and no chance of manipulation**

inverse relationship between risk and moral hazard: the higher the risk, the more careful you are, the less moral hazard. vice versa, the lower the risk (eg. an executive officer being paid only a fixed salary), the less you care (the officer will not strive for good performance), the higher the moral hazard (shareholders cannot guarantee that the executive officer will act entirely in company's interest).

### TRADE-OFF BETWEEN ALLEVIATING ADVERSE SELECTION OR MORAL HAZARD

- current value reporting = helpful for predicting company performance and pricing shares (reduces adverse selection) but not as verifiable and cannot assess mgmt performance (doesn't help moral hazard)
- historical cost model = verifiable and less manipulation-prone (reduces moral hazard), but not as useful for estimating current value and predicting share prices (doesn't help adverse selection)

adverse selection involves information related to the *past and present*; moral hazard involves information related to the *future*.

### EARNINGS MANAGEMENT

- much flexibility in choosing accounting standards when preparing financial statements (eg. FIFO vs weighted-avg cost and things like bad debt expense are up to mgmt discretion) because there are so many different varieties of businesses. one size does not fit all.
- however, this can lead to mgmt taking advantage and choosing methods that suit them—earnings management.
- incentives to bias performance upwards:
  - raise share price
  - meet debt covenants and other contract obligations
  - gain more favourable interests rates from lenders
  - higher compensation or bonuses
- or they may also bias downwards:
  - reduce income taxes
  - dump a lot of expenses in a bad year so the following years look better
  - increase likelihood of govt subsidies and trade protection
  - more bargaining power with employee unions
- positive accounting theory = theory for understanding mgmt motivations and their resulting accounting method choices, and their resulting reactions to changes in accounting standards

### SECURITIES MARKETS & EFFICIENT MARKET THEORY (applies to public companies)

- efficient (strong form) = in which the prices of securities in the market accurately reflect *all known information* (public or private), at all times
- efficient (semi-strong form) = in which the prices of securities in the market accurately reflect *all publicly known information*, at all times
- efficient market theory:
  - prices of securities react quickly to accounting information (eg. notice that price changed dramatically and trading volume increased dramatically on the days when earnings reports were released)
  - accounting information competes with other sources of information (eg. notice that prices change on other days, not just when earnings reports come out, so investors are obviously influenced by other sources as well). thus timeliness (releasing accounting information on time) is important and often regulated
  - users have to distinguish new information from what has already been reflected in price change (eg. good news may have already caused the price to jump, so it's no longer a good time to buy because the information is old).
  - it's difficult to earn unusual profits with only publicly available information (the only way is to act very fast after release of new information, before the price has fully adjusted), but it's much easier if you use information that is only privately available (but this would deter outsiders from trading because of the adverse selection, so it's restricted by regulation).
  - users are assumed to have a reasonable level of sophistication. not all users have to understand the accounting information, but enough are that they are able to ensure the prices properly reflect that information. the less sophisticated users then rely on the market price, rather than the accounting information, to make decisions. investors who rely on the price rather than directly on the financial statements *can still have a claim against a company for misrepresentation in the financial statements*.

![apple securities](/resources/uw/images/apple.jpg){:width="100%"}{: .image-right}

investments made by a company in another company's securities are recorded on the BS at market value (because they are traded in an efficient market, thus the market price is a reliable number), but other assets of the company like inventory and equipment are recorded at historical cost (because there is no reliable way to gauge the current value of these items).

#### Case 4 Bremner Health Insurance Company (30 minutes)

*Bremner Health Insurance Company (BHIC) is a publicly traded medical insurance company in the United States. At the time of establishment in 2019, the company decided to provide medical insurance to consumers without conducting a medical exam or asking for information about medical history. BHIC believed that everyone should have the right to medical insurance coverage, regardless of his or her medical health.*

*In its first two years of operation, the company generated earnings of $1.13 per share in 2019 and $1.25 per share in 2020 and was becoming very popular among consumers as the go-to place for medical insurance. Several financial analysts have been closely following the company and have forecast earnings of $1.45 per share for 2021, as they believe the company will present good news on its earnings announcement date. On February 9, 2022, its shares were trading on the market for $128.60 per share. The next day the company released its 2021 year-end earnings and announced earnings of $1.38 per share, well short of analysts’ expectations of $1.45 per share. The company disclosed in the notes that it had incurred large medical coverage expenses during 2021 primarily because of many of its customers suffering from terminal illnesses. After the earnings announcement, BHIC’s share price fell to $124.40 per share.*

*Required:*

*What type of information asymmetry is present in this case and how could BHIC decrease its effects?*

information privately known by BHIC (large medical coverage expenses) were not known to the investors until the release of the 2021 year-end earnings report. BHIC could issue more press releases on significant things like this that are expected to impact shareholders' decisions related to the company. frequent press releases may lead to softer fluctuations.

*Assuming a semi-strong form efficient market, why do you believe the share price fell on the day of the earnings announcement?*

that day, the fact that BHIC's earnings had fallen short of analyst estimates became public information, and according to the theory of efficient markets, the price of shares reacts quickly to accounting information. a lot of traders would have been paying close attention to the release of the earnings report, and once it came out, many would have disposed of shares as quickly as possible to try to sell them, for more than they would be worth upon reflecting the news.

in other words, in a semi-strong form efficient market, the price of securities must reflect all publicly available information, and the information released by the earnings announcement was "bad news," devaluing the price until it properly reflected the news.

*If BHIC had reported earnings of $1.46 per share as its earnings, what reaction would you expect from the market in the days following the announcement?*

since $1.46 is exceeding analysts' expectations of $1.45/share, BHIC share prices would rise, most dramatically on the day of the announcement, and continue rising in the days after, until the price fully adjusts to reflect this good news.

*How important do you believe meeting forecast expectations is for publicly traded companies, and what kind of problems do you see arising as a result of attempting to meet these forecasts?*

it is hugely important because it's an important piece of public information available to investors, and they will use it to predict the company's profitability in the future. if a company meets or exceeds expectations, it's a sign that they are doing well and may continue to grow in the future. if a company fails to meet expectations, it means investors have overestimated the company's performance, and they may sell shares accordingly because it is not as good of an investment as they expected.

problems may arise from the company's management trying to manipulate the financial statement (eg. by using accounting treatments that inflate the bottom line) in order to reach the forecasted expectations, even if they are inflating actual company performance. this would increase the information asymmetry between mgmt and investors/creditors and further mislead those who depend on the financial reports to make decisions about investing in or lending money to the company.

## Chapter 2

### GENERAL STRUCTURE OF AN ACCOUNTING STANDARD

typically includes these sections:

- objective
- scope
- definitions
- recognition → acquisition → measurement → derecognition
- measurement
- disclosure
- effective dates

### IFRS vs ASPE

- IFRS if public enterprise
- ASPE if private enterprise (unless IFRS is required, eg. by a bank lending money to the enterprise, or it's going public soon)

### IFRS CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

![ifrs framework](/resources/uw/images/framework.jpg){:width="100%"}

1. users = "existing and potential investors, lenders, and other creditors," ie. those who provide financial resources to the enterprise
  - note that other users, like customers and employees, are not provided for by IFRS (though they were in previous editions of the framework)
1. objective = providing information that users will find helpful in making investment and lending decisions
  - financial reporting should:
    - talk about the amount, timing, and uncertainty of future cash flows the user can expect to receive in return for their inputs into the entity
    - provide information on the entity's available resources, claims against the entity, and entity's past performance
    - these are all helpful predictors of entity's future prospects that aid user in determining whether or not to invest/lend
1. fundamental qualitative characteristics (absolutely crucial, otherwise information is useless):
  - relevance = FS must cover issues that the users are concerned with
  - representational faithfulness = the value given in the FS of a line item should be pretty close to its true value
  - enhancing qualitative characteristics (not crucial, but increases the usefulness):
    - understandability = legible, easy to read, etc.
    - comparability = can compare the FS of one company to another (eg. BMO statements can be compared to CIBC statements)
    - verifiability = the values given in the FS can be confirmed or supported (the whole point of audit is to verify FS)
    - timeliness = not outdated, information has to be current
    - prudence (an addition to the 2020 framework) = trying to do your best to give an accurate picture, ie. not overstating or understating assets, liabilities, income, and expenses.
1. elements of financial statements
  - elements for measuring financial position:
    - assets
    - liabilities
    - equity
  - elements for measuring performance:
    - income
    - revenues and gains
    - expenses and losses
1. recognition
  - when to record something as a line item? or when to simply disclose it in the notes?
  - probable and measurable future flows
  - when to record revenue
  - to be recognized, the item must meet its definition and meet the criteria of being *relevant* and *faithfully represented*
    - if the probability of economic benefits is low, may not be relevant
    - if measurement uncertainty is high, may not fulfill the faithful representation requirement
      - cash has *low* measurement uncertainty (it has a solid value)
      - a car has a higher measurement uncertainty (depends on the type of car, how often it's driven, how well it's maintained... etc. harder to know its true value for sure than cold hard cash.)
      - human capital has such a high measurement uncertainty that it cannot be included in FS (no accurate way to measure with any certainty)
      - many intangible assets (eg. patents) also have high measurement uncertainty and cannot be recorded on FS
  - derecognition = when an item is removed from the FS (eg. when a building is sold, or if it's totally destroyed)
1. measurement
  - once something is recognized, how *much* of it to report?
  - historical cost basis = actual amount of cash paid
  - current cost basis = amount of cash needed to purchase the item at this moment (or to wipe a liability)
  - realizable value = amount of cash to be earned by selling asset
  - present value = discounted value of expected future cash flows from the item
1. cost constraint = the cost of financial reporting should not exceed the benefits that can be obtained from using the information, ie. accounting information cannot be made 100% accurate or reliable because that would be too costly and not make sense for the company or its users
1. assumptions = must be made to simplify and generalize situations
  - going concern
  - financial capital maintenance

companies can also report *additional information* not required by IFRS but may satisfy the needs of users not covered by IFRS. eg. pro forma income statements are reported by many companies, even though they are not valid under IFRS (they don't contain things like financing costs or depreciation), they could be more useful to some users than the IFRS-compliant statements.

### ASSETS UNDER IFRS

- definition = a *present* economic resource controlled by the entity as a result of *past* events (new definition no longer requires that the asset is *expected* to earn future financial benefit)
- recognition = probable that future economic benefits will flow

#### Example: App Designers Inc.

- assets are important because it can be used to calculate the liquidity ratio, which shows the likelihood of your company being a going concern
- assets provide *assurance* to the creditor that they are likely to be paid back (collateral)—sales themselves are not a guarantee because sales can suddenly dry up due to market changes
- assets provide indication of company's past performance (only a profitable company can afford to own large assets)
- cannot include app designers in assets because their value cannot be measured with certainty
- does not meet criteria to be recognized as an asset

#### Example: Computer Consulting Limited

- net income (accrual) = 269,000
- net income (cash) = (794,000)

## Chapter 3

### CASH BASIS VS ACCRUAL BASIS

why is it helpful to have periodic reporting (as opposed to simply waiting until dissolution of the company)?

- corporations have indefinite lives (you may have to wait centuries for a company to dissolve then report its profits!)
- it's more cost-effective for corporations to report all information at pre-specified intervals, rather than respond to information requests from each individual investor or lender

cash cycle = a set of transactions that sees cash outflows converted to cash inflows or vice versa

- financing cash cycle = receive funding from investors → use the funds to generate returns → return funds to investors
- investing cash cycle = use funds to purchase long-term property → use property to obtain funds → dispose of property
- operating cash cycle = use funds to purchase inventory → sell the inventory to generate funds → receive funds from customers
- the difference between investing and operating cash cycles can be blurry (since both involve outflows followed by inflows), but generally investing cash cycles are longer to complete

accrual basis accounting used in combination with periodic reporting provides information on *works in progress* (projects that may not yet have resulted in actual *cash* inflow but are in the process of earning income); to leave this information out would be providing *incomplete information* to users

(note: *deferral* refers to amounts recognized *after* the actual receipt of cash; aka recognizing sales revenue *after* cash was already received is *deferral of revenue*)

### QUALITY OF EARNINGS

since accrual accounting requires the use of *estimates*, financial statements made from these estimates cannot be considered verifiably "true," so instead the gold standard is "unbiased" and "presented fairly."

quality of earnings is one aspect of fair presentation, ie. how unbiased the reported earnings are.

- higher quality of earnings = less managerial bias, reported earnings closer to true earnings
- lower quality of earnings = high managerial bias, reported earnings much lower than true earnings

quality of earnings all comes down to treatment of accruals and how accurate they are.

- unbiased accruals = accurately reflect the economic situation and calculated with professional judgement and ethics
- excessive accruals = result from incentives for either the firm or the individual manager themselves to over- or under-accrue

ideally, if we knew the amount of excessive accruals we would know exactly the quality of earnings, but since we don't, we have to make *conjectures* based on how much incentive for earnings management is present in the company.

same principal can be applied to quality of balance sheet and quality of income statement.

### PERIODICITY, CUT-OFF, AND SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

- periodicity = the period over which a company's financial statements cover
  - usually 12-month period, ending Dec 31, but depending on the company's industry may be slightly more or less than 12 months to more accurately reflect company performance (eg. retail companies)
- cut-off = the point at which one reporting period ends and the next one begins (usually Dec 31 for most corporations)
  - important to define rules for which events should be recognize prior to cut-off and which ones should be reported in the following period to keep year-to-year reporting consistent
- subsequent-events period = period between the cut-off date and the date on which a company authorizes its financial statements to be issued
  - if a material piece of information is discovered during the subsequent-events period, but after the cut-off date, the company should include this change in the FS it is working on
  - basically, *recognition* of events must occur within before the cut-off, but *measurement* of those same events can use information from the subsequent-events period
  - eg. if a transport truck is destroyed in an accident, company needs to write it off.
    - if the truck was in the accident prior to cut-off, but this only became known to the company in the subsequent-events period, then the write-off should be included in CY financial statements.
    - if the truck was crashed during the subsequent-events period, the write-off should not be recognized in CY (but company should disclose it in the notes).

### ACCOUNTING CHANGES

- correction of errors = a straight-up typo
  - must be wrong even at the time it was made
    - eg. mgmt estimates the useful life of an asset to be 5 years but then applies 10% straight-line depreciation
    - eg. a good faith estimate that turned out to be wildly off the mark in later years is *not* an error
  - no hindsight is needed to see that it is wrong
  - treatment: **retrospective adjustment with restatement**
    - retrospective adjustment = applies the change to all periods affected whether they are in the past, present, or future
    - with restatement = any affected PY financial statements must also be restated
    - the point is to restore all financial statements to what they should've been based on the available information at the time
- change in accounting policy = an alteration due to mgmt *choice* (not due to new information)
  - eg. changing inventory treatment from FIFO to weighted avg
  - eg. change in depreciation from straight-line to declining-balance (but this could also be considered a change in estimate, see below)
  - treatment: **retrospective adjustment with restatement**
    - because users will need to look to prior years to make meaningful comparisons, given the new policy
    - if not restated, the cumulative effects of the policy change on PYs will significantly impact the CY income
- change in accounting estimate = an alteration due to receipt of new information (not mgmt choice)
  - eg. changing estimate of bad debt expense as a % of sales
  - eg. changing depreciation from straight-line to declining-balance (if the declining-balance method more closely matches the pattern of use of the equipment, and this information was not known at the time the original straight-line policy was put in place)
  - treatment: **prospective adjustment** = applies the change only to the CY and future periods
    - because the information on which the new estimate is made was not available at the time the original estimate was made, the previous periods should not be affected

### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS COVERED BY IFRS

- all four FS, plus note disclosures
- MD&A and reports on environmental performance, corporate social responsibility, value added, etc. are not covered

articulation means that all four FS are connected to each other; changes in one will impact the others

balance sheet (BS):

- double-entry accounting means the BS is self-contained:
- assets and liabilities should be categorized by current/non-current (could also order by liquidity, if that provides more useful information)
  - eg. banks should order their line items by liquidity
  - the order of categories doesn't matter; european companies often list equity accounts first, and non-current before current
  - assets:
    - cash and cash equivalents; trade and other receivables; investments; other financial assets; inventories; biological assets; PPE (could be split into their own classes if necessary, esp if different cost bases); investment property; intangible assets; receivables for current tax; deferred tax assets
    - a "current" asset must meet one of the following criteria:
      1. held primarily for trading
      1. asset is to be consumed in the company's normal operating cycle, or within 12 months after the reporting period, whichever is longer
      1. it's a cash or cash equivalent (unless it's restricted from being consumed for 12 months)
  - liabilities:
    - trade and other payables; provisions (eg. warranty liabilities, pension benefits, restructuring costs); other financial liabilities; liability for taxes payable; liability for deferred taxes
    - "current" liability must meet one of the criteria:
      1. to be settled within the normal operating cycle or within 12 months after reporting period, whichever is longer
      1. held primarily for trading
      1. the firm does not have unconditional discretion to defer settlement for at least 12 months
        - eg. line of credit is a current liability
  - equity:
    - contributed capital; retained earnings; reserves; non-controlling interest
- all income statement accts (expenses and revenues, gains and losses) are temporary accounts and are closed at the end of the year into the equity account, which goes on the BS.
- items in the BS should be grouped together
  - immaterial groupings can be combined with other immaterial groups to become "other"

statement of changes in equity (SCE):

- 3 components:
  1. contributed capital = the cash put in by the owners - (repayments to the owners + repurchase of shares from the owners)
  1. retained earnings = the cumulative profits (losses) of the company as reported in the IS - dividends paid out
  1. reserves = cumulative amounts from events that were not from one of the above two sources, but that nevertheless increase equity
- 5 types of transactions that can affect the above 3 components of equity:
  1. profit or loss (recorded on IS): affects retained earnings
  1. OCI (other comprehensive income): affects reserves (or sometimes directly affects retained earnings)
    - = income derived from change in value that are not yet realized via a transaction
      - eg. unrealized gains when the bonds you've invested in increase in value, but you don't plan on selling them yet
    - "recycling" = accumulating recognized OCI in reserves rather than immediately impacting that year's net income and retained earnings
      - OCI that is recycled will be parked in the reserve until the transaction actually happens (eg. when you actually sell the bonds)
      - OCI that is not recycled will affect net income and retained earnings just like any other source of income
      - called "recycled" because the income is recognized twice: first, recognized through OCI, second, recognized through net income
  1. paying out dividends: affects retained earnings
  1. capital transactions (aka transactions with owners, ie. issuing shares or repurchasing shares): affects contributed capital (or sometimes affects retained earnings)
  1. effect of changes in accounting policy or correction of errors: affects contributed capital or retained earnings

statement of comprehensive income (IS):

must contain the following, at a minimum:

- revenue
- operating expenses
  - expenses should be classified according to their *nature* (eg. depreciation, labour cost, cost of raw materials, etc.) or *function* (cogs, distribution, admin, etc.)
  - if entities choose to classify expenses according to function, they still need to provide information on (at a minimum) employee benefits expense, depreciation, and amortization
  - thus, information *must* be provided on the *nature* of expenses, but *function* is optional
- financing costs
- share of profit or loss of associates
- tax expense
- net income (loss)
- OCI
- total comprehensive income
- earnings per share (EPS) must be disclosed either in the IS or in the notes (because a shareholder holding a tiny portion of the total shares will care more about how much *his* share in the company has earned, rather than the total profit of the entire firm)

statement of cash flows (SCF):

- direct method: adds up the actual cash expenditures in operating, financing, and investing to arrive at the cash flows for each activity
- indirect method: starts with net income from the IS and adds back non-cash expenditures and deducts non-cash earnings to arrive at the cash flows

note disclosures:

- typically the longest section of the FS
- must contain following:
  - statement of compliance with IFRS (whether or not it complies with IFRS in its entirety)
  - summary of significant accounting policies (measurement bases)
  - disclosures relevant to understanding each item reported on the four FS
  - other specific disclosures required by IFRS

other IFRS reporting requirements:

- discontinued operations = operations that the company has decided to stop working on
  - eg. a national retail chain decides to sell its holdings in eastern canada to focus on its western canada locations
  - all line items relating to the discontinued portion of the business must be reported separately because the discontinued operation no longer satisfies the *going concern* assumption
    - eg. "profit from discontinued operations" would be a separate line item on the IS, not combined with the profit from the rest of the company
  - same with non-current assets held for sale
- comparative figures
  - FS for CY and PYs need to be comparable
  - so any time a company makes a change (eg. splitting a line item into two separate line items), they need to provide comparative figures for PYs using the same treatment, to help FS users discern trends
