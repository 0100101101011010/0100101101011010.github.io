## Chapter 1

### WHAT IS ACCOUNTING

- Financial accounting = aka financial reporting; providing information to external parties eg. shareholders
- Managerial accounting = provide info *within* enterprise
- Tax accounting = providing info on taxable amounts to government revenue agency

### SUPPLY AND DEMAND

- accounting is an *economic good*, and is subject to laws of supply and demand
- thus accounting standards are not arbitrarily set by the governing bodies but by the *demand for financial information* and the ability of enterprises to *supply the demanded information*

### INFORMATION ASYMMETRY

- external parties make decisions regarding the enterprise *under uncertainty*, which leads to the demand for financial reporting to help them predict outcomes
- information = evidence that can *potentially affect* someone's decisions (doesn't necessarily alter the decision, but it could)
- some evidence can be information to one person but not information to someone else (who has a different decision context)
- information asymmetry = some people have more information than others regarding performance of an enterprise

### ADVERSE SELECTION aka *hidden information*

when one party to a contract has more *information* than the other party (eg. when investors are deciding whether or not to buy shares in a company or lenders are deciding whether or not to extend credit, they have less information than mgmt of the company)

- adverse selection causes investors to be way of overpaying (since they have information asymmetry against them): therefore, without information, they will only be willing to pay the lowest price
- thus, company wants to provide information that persuades you to purchase their shares at a higher price
- **demand: for information related to investment decisions**

companies must provide evidence to potential investors that their share prices are worth something.

- cheap talk vs credible evidence:
  - cheap talk is a unverifiable claim (eg. "these shares are underpriced"), which is useless.
  - credible evidence includes financial statements. often requires independent auditors to provide third-party testimony to the company's performance.
- companies can also use a *costly signal* (something that is expensive for the company), like dividends, which signal that the company has enough cash flows to pay out dividends.

### MORAL HAZARD aka *hidden actions*

when one party to a contract cannot observe some *actions* of the other party in fulfilling the contract

- mgmt has motivation to *exaggerate* company's perceived performance (earnings management)
- but mgmt is also the provider of information
- thus, investors and lenders want to insure the information received is credible
- **demand: for information that is verifiable and no chance of manipulation**

inverse relationship between risk and moral hazard: the higher the risk, the more careful you are, the less moral hazard. vice versa, the lower the risk (eg. an executive officer being paid only a fixed salary), the less you care (the officer will not strive for good performance), the higher the moral hazard (shareholders cannot guarantee that the executive officer will act entirely in company's interest).

### TRADE-OFF BETWEEN ALLEVIATING ADVERSE SELECTION OR MORAL HAZARD

- current value reporting = helpful for predicting company performance and pricing shares (reduces adverse selection) but not as verifiable and cannot assess mgmt performance (doesn't help moral hazard)
- historical cost model = verifiable and less manipulation-prone (reduces moral hazard), but not as useful for estimating current value and predicting share prices (doesn't help adverse selection)

adverse selection involves information related to the *past and present*; moral hazard involves information related to the *future*.

### EARNINGS MANAGEMENT

- much flexibility in choosing accounting standards when preparing financial statements (eg. FIFO vs weighted-avg cost and things like bad debt expense are up to mgmt discretion) because there are so many different varieties of businesses. one size does not fit all.
- however, this can lead to mgmt taking advantage and choosing methods that suit themâ€”earnings management.
- incentives to bias performance upwards:
  - raise share price
  - meet debt covenants and other contract obligations
  - gain more favourable interests rates from lenders
  - higher compensation or bonuses
- or they may also bias downwards:
  - reduce income taxes
  - dump a lot of expenses in a bad year so the following years look better
  - increase likelihood of govt subsidies and trade protection
  - more bargaining power with employee unions
- positive accounting theory = theory for understanding mgmt motivations and their resulting accounting method choices, and their resulting reactions to changes in accounting standards

### SECURITIES MARKETS & EFFICIENT MARKET THEORY (applies to public companies)

- efficient (strong form) = in which the prices of securities in the market accurately reflect *all known information* (public or private), at all times
- efficient (semi-strong form) = in which the prices of securities in the market accurately reflect *all publicly known information*, at all times
- efficient market theory:
  - prices of securities react quickly to accounting information (eg. notice that price changed dramatically and trading volume increased dramatically on the days when earnings reports were released)
  - accounting information competes with other sources of information (eg. notice that prices change on other days, not just when earnings reports come out, so investors are obviously influenced by other sources as well). thus timeliness (releasing accounting information on time) is important and often regulated
  - users have to distinguish new information from what has already been reflected in price change (eg. good news may have already caused the price to jump, so it's no longer a good time to buy because the information is old).
  - it's difficult to earn unusual profits with only publicly available information (the only way is to act very fast after release of new information, before the price has fully adjusted), but it's much easier if you use information that is only privately available (but this would deter outsiders from trading because of the adverse selection, so it's restricted by regulation).
  - users are assumed to have a reasonable level of sophistication. not all users have to understand the accounting information, but enough are that they are able to ensure the prices properly reflect that information. the less sophisticated users then rely on the market price, rather than the accounting information, to make decisions. investors who rely on the price rather than directly on the financial statements *can still have a claim against a company for misrepresentation in the financial statements*.
