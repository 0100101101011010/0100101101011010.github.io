## Chapter 1

### WHAT IS ACCOUNTING

- Financial accounting = aka financial reporting; providing information to external parties eg. shareholders
- Managerial accounting = provide info *within* enterprise
- Tax accounting = providing info on taxable amounts to government revenue agency

### SUPPLY AND DEMAND

- accounting is an *economic good*, and is subject to laws of supply and demand
- thus accounting standards are not arbitrarily set by the governing bodies but by the *demand for financial information* and the ability of enterprises to *supply the demanded information*

### INFORMATION ASYMMETRY

- external parties make decisions regarding the enterprise *under uncertainty*, which leads to the demand for financial reporting to help them predict outcomes
- information = evidence that can *potentially affect* someone's decisions (doesn't necessarily alter the decision, but it could)
- some evidence can be information to one person but not information to someone else (who has a different decision context)
- information asymmetry = some people have more information than others regarding performance of an enterprise

#### P1-2. Supply and demand for accounting information (L.O. 1–1) (Easy – 10 minutes)

*In the context of an entrepreneur seeking an initial public offering (IPO) of shares in her company, discuss the concepts of uncertainty, information asymmetry, and the supply of and demand for information.*

investors have an information disadvantage because up to this point, the company has been private and little information regarding its operations, performance, or profitability have been divulged. investors would want to pay the lowest price for these shares, then, because they have no basis on which to value the shares and would logically assume they are worthless. to buy shares, they demand information that would help them predict the company's future performance and assess whether the shares would go up in value. the entrepreneur would have to supply credible information to meet these demands, likely having to prepare financial statements audited independently for maximum credibility.

#### P1-3. Supply and demand for accounting information (L.O. 1–1) (Easy – 10 minutes)

*Discuss the concepts of uncertainty, information asymmetry, and the supply of and demand for information when a corporation applies for a bank loan.*

the corporation management has an information advantage over the loan officers, who would be unwilling to extend credit if they do not know about the riskiness of lending money to the corporation and how likely it is to be able to repay the loan. the corporation must supply credible financial information demanded by the bank to assess its future liquidity, such as projected cash flows and financial ratios.

### ADVERSE SELECTION aka *hidden information*

when one party to a contract has more *information* than the other party (eg. when investors are deciding whether or not to buy shares in a company or lenders are deciding whether or not to extend credit, they have less information than mgmt of the company)

- adverse selection causes investors to be way of overpaying (since they have information asymmetry against them): therefore, without information, they will only be willing to pay the lowest price
- thus, company wants to provide information that persuades you to purchase their shares at a higher price
- **demand: for information related to investment decisions**

companies must provide evidence to potential investors that their share prices are worth something.

- cheap talk vs credible evidence:
  - cheap talk is a unverifiable claim (eg. "these shares are underpriced"), which is useless.
  - credible evidence includes financial statements. often requires independent auditors to provide third-party testimony to the company's performance.
- companies can also use a *costly signal* (something that is expensive for the company), like dividends, which signal that the company has enough cash flows to pay out dividends.

### MORAL HAZARD aka *hidden actions*

when one party to a contract cannot observe some *actions* of the other party in fulfilling the contract

- mgmt has motivation to *exaggerate* company's perceived performance (earnings management)
- but mgmt is also the provider of information
- thus, investors and lenders want to insure the information received is credible
- **demand: for information that is verifiable and no chance of manipulation**

inverse relationship between risk and moral hazard: the higher the risk, the more careful you are, the less moral hazard. vice versa, the lower the risk (eg. an executive officer being paid only a fixed salary), the less you care (the officer will not strive for good performance), the higher the moral hazard (shareholders cannot guarantee that the executive officer will act entirely in company's interest).

### TRADE-OFF BETWEEN ALLEVIATING ADVERSE SELECTION OR MORAL HAZARD

- current value reporting = helpful for predicting company performance and pricing shares (reduces adverse selection) but not as verifiable and cannot assess mgmt performance (doesn't help moral hazard)
- historical cost model = verifiable and less manipulation-prone (reduces moral hazard), but not as useful for estimating current value and predicting share prices (doesn't help adverse selection)

adverse selection involves information related to the *past and present*; moral hazard involves information related to the *future*.

### EARNINGS MANAGEMENT

- much flexibility in choosing accounting standards when preparing financial statements (eg. FIFO vs weighted-avg cost and things like bad debt expense are up to mgmt discretion) because there are so many different varieties of businesses. one size does not fit all.
- however, this can lead to mgmt taking advantage and choosing methods that suit them—earnings management.
- incentives to bias performance upwards:
  - raise share price
  - meet debt covenants and other contract obligations
  - gain more favourable interests rates from lenders
  - higher compensation or bonuses
- or they may also bias downwards:
  - reduce income taxes
  - dump a lot of expenses in a bad year so the following years look better
  - increase likelihood of govt subsidies and trade protection
  - more bargaining power with employee unions
- positive accounting theory = theory for understanding mgmt motivations and their resulting accounting method choices, and their resulting reactions to changes in accounting standards

### SECURITIES MARKETS & EFFICIENT MARKET THEORY (applies to public companies)

- efficient (strong form) = in which the prices of securities in the market accurately reflect *all known information* (public or private), at all times
- efficient (semi-strong form) = in which the prices of securities in the market accurately reflect *all publicly known information*, at all times
- efficient market theory:
  - prices of securities react quickly to accounting information (eg. notice that price changed dramatically and trading volume increased dramatically on the days when earnings reports were released)
  - accounting information competes with other sources of information (eg. notice that prices change on other days, not just when earnings reports come out, so investors are obviously influenced by other sources as well). thus timeliness (releasing accounting information on time) is important and often regulated
  - users have to distinguish new information from what has already been reflected in price change (eg. good news may have already caused the price to jump, so it's no longer a good time to buy because the information is old).
  - it's difficult to earn unusual profits with only publicly available information (the only way is to act very fast after release of new information, before the price has fully adjusted), but it's much easier if you use information that is only privately available (but this would deter outsiders from trading because of the adverse selection, so it's restricted by regulation).
  - users are assumed to have a reasonable level of sophistication. not all users have to understand the accounting information, but enough are that they are able to ensure the prices properly reflect that information. the less sophisticated users then rely on the market price, rather than the accounting information, to make decisions. investors who rely on the price rather than directly on the financial statements *can still have a claim against a company for misrepresentation in the financial statements*.

investments made by a company in another company's securities are recorded on the BS at market value (because they are traded in an efficient market, thus the market price is a reliable number), but other assets of the company like inventory and equipment are recorded at historical cost (because there is no reliable way to gauge the current value of these items).

#### Case 4 Bremner Health Insurance Company (30 minutes)

*Bremner Health Insurance Company (BHIC) is a publicly traded medical insurance company in the United States. At the time of establishment in 2019, the company decided to provide medical insurance to consumers without conducting a medical exam or asking for information about medical history. BHIC believed that everyone should have the right to medical insurance coverage, regardless of his or her medical health.*

*In its first two years of operation, the company generated earnings of $1.13 per share in 2019 and $1.25 per share in 2020 and was becoming very popular among consumers as the go-to place for medical insurance. Several financial analysts have been closely following the company and have forecast earnings of $1.45 per share for 2021, as they believe the company will present good news on its earnings announcement date. On February 9, 2022, its shares were trading on the market for $128.60 per share. The next day the company released its 2021 year-end earnings and announced earnings of $1.38 per share, well short of analysts’ expectations of $1.45 per share. The company disclosed in the notes that it had incurred large medical coverage expenses during 2021 primarily because of many of its customers suffering from terminal illnesses. After the earnings announcement, BHIC’s share price fell to $124.40 per share.*

*Required:*

*1. What type of information asymmetry is present in this case and how could BHIC decrease its effects?*

information privately known by BHIC (large medical coverage expenses) were not known to the investors until the release of the 2021 year-end earnings report. BHIC could issue more press releases on significant things like this that are expected to impact shareholders' decisions related to the company. frequent press releases may lead to softer fluctuations.

*1. Assuming a semi-strong form efficient market, why do you believe the share price fell on the day of the earnings announcement?*

that day, the fact that BHIC's earnings had fallen short of analyst estimates became public information, and according to the theory of efficient markets, the price of shares reacts quickly to accounting information. a lot of traders would have been paying close attention to the release of the earnings report, and once it came out, many would have disposed of shares as quickly as possible to try to sell them, for more than they would be worth upon reflecting the news.

in other words, in a semi-strong form efficient market, the price of securities must reflect all publicly available information, and the information released by the earnings announcement was "bad news," devaluing the price until it properly reflected the news.

*1. If BHIC had reported earnings of $1.46 per share as its earnings, what reaction would you expect from the market in the days following the announcement?*

since $1.46 is exceeding analysts' expectations of $1.45/share, BHIC share prices would rise, most dramatically on the day of the announcement, and continue rising in the days after, until the price fully adjusts to reflect this good news.

*1. How important do you believe meeting forecast expectations is for publicly traded companies, and what kind of problems do you see arising as a result of attempting to meet these forecasts?*

it is hugely important because it's an important piece of public information available to investors, and they will use it to predict the company's profitability in the future. if a company meets or exceeds expectations, it's a sign that they are doing well and may continue to grow in the future. if a company fails to meet expectations, it means investors have overestimated the company's performance, and they may sell shares accordingly because it is not as good of an investment as they expected.

problems may arise from the company's management trying to manipulate the financial statement (eg. by using accounting treatments that inflate the bottom line) in order to reach the forecasted expectations, even if they are inflating actual company performance. this would increase the information asymmetry between mgmt and investors/creditors and further mislead those who depend on the financial reports to make decisions about investing in or lending money to the company.
