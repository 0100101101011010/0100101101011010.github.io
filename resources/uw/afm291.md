## Chapter 1

### WHAT IS ACCOUNTING

- Financial accounting = aka financial reporting; providing information to external parties eg. shareholders
- Managerial accounting = provide info *within* enterprise
- Tax accounting = providing info on taxable amounts to government revenue agency

### SUPPLY AND DEMAND

- accounting is an *economic good*, and is subject to laws of supply and demand
- thus accounting standards are not arbitrarily set by the governing bodies but by the *demand for financial information* and the ability of enterprises to *supply the demanded information*

### INFORMATION ASYMMETRY

- external parties make decisions regarding the enterprise *under uncertainty*, which leads to the demand for financial reporting to help them predict outcomes
- information = evidence that can *potentially affect* someone's decisions (doesn't necessarily alter the decision, but it could)
- some evidence can be information to one person but not information to someone else (who has a different decision context)
- information asymmetry = some people have more information than others regarding performance of an enterprise

### ADVERSE SELECTION

for cases of when investors are deciding whether or not to buy shares in a company

- adverse selection causes investors to be way of overpaying (since they have information asymmetry against them)
- thus, company wants to provide information that causes share price to be higher
- **demand: for information related to investment decisions**

### MORAL HAZARD

- mgmt has motivation to *exaggerate* company's perceived performance (earnings management)
- but mgmt is also the provider of information
- thus, investors and lenders want to insure the information received is credible
- **demand: for information that is verifiable and no chance of manipulation**

### TRADE-OFF BETWEEN ALLEVIATING ADVERSE SELECTION OR MORAL HAZARD

- current value reporting = helpful for predicting company performance and pricing shares (reduces adverse selection) but not as verifiable and cannot assess mgmt performance (doesn't help moral hazard)
- historical cost model = verifiable and less manipulation-prone (reduces moral hazard), but not as useful for estimating current value and predicting share prices (doesn't help adverse selection)

### EARNINGS MANAGEMENT

- much flexibility in choosing accounting standards when preparing financial statements (eg. FIFO vs weighted-avg cost and things like bad debt expense are up to mgmt discretion) because there are so many different varieties of businesses. one size does not fit all.
- however, this can lead to mgmt taking advantage and choosing methods that suit them - earnings management.
- incentives to bias performance upwards:
  - raise share price
  - meet debt covenants and other contract obligations
  - gain more favourable interests rates from lenders
  - higher compensation or bonuses
- or they may also bias downwards:
  - reduce income taxes
  - dump a lot of expenses in a bad year so the following years look better
  - increase likelihood of govt subsidies and trade protection
  - more bargaining power with employee unions
- positive accounting theory = theory for understanding mgmt motivations and their resulting accounting method choices, and their resulting reactions to changes in accounting standards

### SECURITIES MARKETS & EFFICIENT MARKET THEORY (applies to public companies)

- efficient (strong form) = in which the prices of securities in the market accurately reflect *all known information* (public or private), at all times
- efficient (semi-strong form) = in which the prices of securities in the market accurately reflect *all publicly known information*, at all times
- efficient market theory:
  - prices of securities react quickly to accounting information (eg. notice that price changed dramatically and trading volume increased dramatically on the days when earnings reports were released)
