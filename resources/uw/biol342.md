## Review

monocistronic = only 1 gene in the mRNA

polycistronic: each gene has its own ribosome-binding site (SD + AUG)

polycistronic mRNA is not an operon because there is no control (no operator present on the gene) they are constitutive, aka housekeeping, genes

- genes become blurry... in an operon, only one promoter and one terminator controls production of *several proteins*... however, they are typically still considered distinct genes rather than one gene coding for several proteins

- shine-dalgarno isn't right at the 5' end, there's some space
- then some more space between SD and start codon (usually ~6–10 bp)
- in most cases, the fM (translated from the start codon) is cleaved off in post-translational processing

### POST-TRANSCRIPTIONAL MODIFICATION

- 5' guanine cap
- 3' polyadenine tail: contributes to stability

### POST-TRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATION

- often, Met/fMet is removed

### STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DNA AND mRNA

- mRNA does not have Promoter or Terminator (those belong to DNA only)—well, part of the Terminator remains, but not the entire thing
- start codon in mRNA is AUG, not ATG (also ATG has no impact on DNA)
- shine-dalgarno sequence exists in both, but only has an impact on translation (mRNA → protein)
- codons are only ever in the CDS / ORF
  - eg. cannot call the nucleotides in the SD a codon, because that region is not translated
