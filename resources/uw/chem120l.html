    Waterloo courses I've taken. Some high school stuff here too.
    Flashcards are the easiest way for me to retain information. At
    this point, I don't take notes for my classes anymore. It's
    all flashcards all the way, baby. I use the Anki software to
    create and host them. Anki also allows sharing decks publicly,
    which is what I've done with some of the courses I've completed,
    as below." />

    <p>Hello CHEM 120L students!!
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Experiment 1: Reactions of Copper</h2>

    <p><i>Lab report feedback will go here :-)</i></p>

    <p>Note: it's going to be really tough to get a good percent yield in this lab; your calculated percent yield will actually probably be over 100%. This is a normal result! Try to figure out what caused this error.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>General tips</h2>

        <h3>Procedure summary</h3>
        <p>Read the lab procedure for the week's experiment beforehand and write a detailed Procedure Summary. You should be familiar enough so you can go into the lab and get started right away. If you have questions about any part of the procedure, and Google can't help you, message me right away. Don't wait until the day of. You won't have time to figure it out during the lab itself.</p>

        <h3>Figures and graphs</h3>
        <p>Label all your axes and make sure they have units. Make your graph titles descriptive (titles like "X versus Y" or "Y as a responding variable of X" is <b>not acceptable</b>).</p>

        <h3>References</h3>
        <p>Any time you include information in your report that you had to Google (this includes constants, and numbers like melting points, boiling points, etc.), you must cite it. We prefer using ACS formatted citations but anything like MLA or APA is fine.</p>

        <h3>Asking for help</h3>
        <p>My email is always open! You can also use the form below to ask me a question and I will post the answer here on this page. But allow for a 24-hour response time. If you email me at 3 AM before your lab report is due I probably won't reply :-/</p>
