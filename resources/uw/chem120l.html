    <p>Hello CHEM 120L students!!
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Experiment 1: Reactions of Copper</h2>

    <p><i>Lab report feedback will go here :-)</i></p>

    <p>Note: it's going to be really tough to get a good percent yield in this lab; your calculated percent yield will actually probably be over 100%. This is a normal result! Try to figure out what caused this error.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Laboratory conduct (aka how to guarantee that 5/5 performance mark)</h2>

      <p>Don't leave your lab bench unattended. Except for at the beginning of the lab, only one partner should be going to the fume hood, the back bench, etc to grab materials. At least one person should be watching over the bench at all times. If you're at your bench but on your phone, this still counts as unattended. It's okay to use phones during the lab, sometimes you need it to take pictures or time a reaction, but don't neglect your experiment!</p>

      <p>Clean your bench top with the soapy spray and paper towels before leaving. If you don't wipe it down, I will be deducting 1 mark from your performance mark.</p>

      <p>Remember to get me to sign your data sheet before you leave the lab.</p>

      <p>Be cognizant of time: you should read the procedure in the lab manual thoroughly and come into the lab knowing exactly what steps to follow. All of the experiments in this course can be completed within 2 hours, so you should have plenty of time. From the second experiment onwards, any groups that are still in the lab past 5:20 pm will have 1 mark deducted. Don't let this affect the quality of your work though! If a product is not forming, a reaction is not happening, etc. let me know and don't try to push on through the experiment. I don't expect every experiment to run smoothly and I won't penalize you for finishing late if something happens outside your control.</p>

    <h2>General tips</h2>

        <h3>Formatting</h3>
        <p>Please ensure nothing on your report is in pencil. Black ink is best. Before you hand it in, triple check all pages are stapled in the right order. Seems like a no-brainer but I've lost marks on this before :-(</p>
        <p>Ensure you're following the space limit for all sections of the lab report. If the manual says Discussion shouldn't exceed one page, single-sided, marks will be taken off if you go over that.</p>
        <p>For anything that's typed up: Times New Roman font size 12, indent all paragraphs. Title in bold. <b>References</b> have a special indent system: see below.</p>

        <h3>Procedure summary</h3>
        <p>Read the lab procedure for the week's experiment beforehand and write a detailed Procedure Summary. You should be familiar enough so you can go into the lab and get started right away. If you have questions about any part of the procedure, and Google can't help you, message me right away. Don't wait until the day of. You won't have time to figure it out during the lab itself.</p>
        <p>Procedure cannot exceed the page you are given to write on (front and back). If you run out of space, either your writing is really big or you're including too much.</p>

        <h3>Figures and graphs</h3>
        <p>Label all your axes and make sure they have units. Make your graph titles descriptive (titles like "X versus Y" or "Y as a responding variable of X" is <b>not acceptable</b>).</p>

        <h3>Discussion</h3>
        <p>Here you talk about your objectives and whether or not you achieved them; sources of error (try not to bring up human sources); percent yield or percent error + explanation of why this number is acceptable/unacceptable.</p>

        <h3>References</h3>
        <p>Any time you include information in your report that you had to Google (this includes constants, and numbers like melting points, boiling points, etc.), you must cite it. We prefer using ACS formatted citations but anything like MLA or APA is fine.</p>

        <h3>Asking for help</h3>
        <p>My email is always open! You can also use the form below to ask me a question and I will post the answer here on this page. But allow for a 24-hour response time. If you email me at 3 AM before your lab report is due I probably won't reply :-/</p>
